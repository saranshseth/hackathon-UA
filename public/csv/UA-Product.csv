Your day will begin with a very early bus ride (6:45 am). Make your own way to Adelaide Central Bus Station and look for the SeaLink bus inside the bus station. Once inside, head towards the back, where you will find the bus and coach pick up lanes . Once on the bus you'll take a scenic coach ride to Cape Jervis, making sure to take in the picturesque scenery of the Fleurieu Peninsula landscape as you go, watching the vineyards, coastlines and rolling hills along the way. When you arrive at the cape, take the ferry to Kangaroo Island, where you�ll meet your local guide and begin your wildlife discovery.

Visit several island habitats with your guide to see the vast wildlife that lives here on the island in their natural habitat. Without the threat of introduced species, Kangaroo Island is a haven for Australian wildlife, allowing them to live freely in abundance. Listen to the chorus of the vast birdlife high in the eucalyptus trees, many of which are unique to the island, and keep an eye out for echidnas, wallabies, reptiles and all the colourful wildflowers. Your next stop is Seal Bay Conservation Park, where you'll walk among the sea lions as they bask on the beach and the sand dunes. This is a wonderful experience as you'll be close enough to watch them play and communicate. Don�t worry, you�ll be standing at a safe distance from these wonderful, endangered creatures! After, visit an exclusive special Heritage-listed natural bush property for a delicious gourmet picnic-style lunch, followed by a relaxing walk along the beach or maybe a bushwalk. As you walk, keep an eye out for koalas, Tammar wallabies and echidnas as you walk through the island landscape and listen out for Australia�s rarest cockatoo � the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo. Later, watch the kangaroos leave the safety of the bush to begin their evening grazing on the open pastures. As the sun goes down, your day ends in Penneshaw, just in time for the return ferry, which takes you back to the mainland. When you arrive back, you'll have a coach transfer waiting for you to take you back to Adelaide, making for an excellent day.�

Rooftop bars are a favourite place for Melbournians to gather and not just in summer. During winter, some rooftops add a marquee and heaters and carry on regardless.

We also try either an invigorating Greek coffee (in the winter) or a cold frappe on warmer days, which are popular local beverages. Athens food is a rich mix of old and new, traditional and modern, and this tour is the perfect way to discover all these aspects. Next on�your private�culinary tour of Athens, we then drop by a Greek deli that sells traditional products and is a popular shopping place for locals. Here you can chat to the shop owner and ask him about all of his produce � and taste some of course! This spot sells the best seasonal food available, perfect for a picnic in the city if you�d like to return another time during your stay in Athens. Finally, on this Athens tour, you�ll make your way to Monastiraki Square where your adventure will end. Your guide will be happy to recommend other places to see in this ancient city and where some of the best local restaurants are located, if you can stomach even more Greek deliciousness!

Dive into the very soul of Athens and discover exactly what makes this city so very special � aside from all that ancient history. Start this historical Athens walking tour by meeting your local guide in Syntagma Square, the most important and crowded square in Athens, surrounded by impressive neoclassical buildings. The best known is the Grande Bretagne, once a royal palace but now a luxury hotel which has housed everyone from Churchill to Madonna. At the upper end of the square see the Evzones, the guards of the Constitution, and the tomb of the unknown soldier. The Evzones are traditionally dressed with 17th and 18th century clothes: an impressive white skirt, red hat, and an old rifle. The changing of the guard happens every hour, and you simply cannot tour Athens without seeing this spectacle � which is why we�ve incorporated it into this tour! Watch the ceremony while your local guide explains the tradition. Next on this Athens tour you�ll jump on the metro and travel to Acropolis station. Travelling between these stations is like stepping back in time; both have exposed ancient ruins behind glass, discovered during the excavations for the metro system. But these are just a taster of the ancient ruins to come� You�ll exit the station and take a walk around the walls of famous Athens Acropolis, passing by the Ancient Agora. We�ll walk along ancient roads, admire new architecture, and hear about the customs and traditions that still exist today. This is the central hub of classic Athens history, and you�ll hear the stories behind this monument from your local guide.�(Please note that if you wish to tour inside the Acropolis, this will have to be done separately on your own time.) Afterwards, explore the Plaka area. Shop for souvenirs along Adrianou Street, where you can find local products such as ouzo (Greece�s national alcohol). You�ll also see shops that specialise in olive oil, sponges, icons, leather sandals, and bags � something you won't experience on other Athens tours. Continue walking to Diogenis Square, under the impressive wall of the Acropolis. See Hadrian�s Arch, built in honour of one of the most glorified Roman emperors. Directly behind it you can see the ruins of the Jupiter (Zeus) temple as you taste and feel the history of Athens. Pass by the National Garden and Zappeion, to arrive at the white marble Panathinaiko Stadium. It was here that the first Olympic Games took place and where the 2004 Olympic marathon ended. Finally, you�ll be taken back to present-day Athens to admire some of Athens� more modern architecture.We walk through the new city highlights, where life goes on in modern rhythms. See where locals wander , shop, and gather. Visit the Kolonaki area, which is the heart of today�s Athens.

Your guide will be wearing Intrepid Urban Adventures Red sign.",Sant Pau Modernist Centre,"On this walking tour of Catalonian Barcelona, you'll explore one of the most livable cities in the world on foot with a local guide who knows all the best spots. Known for its sunny weather, pristine beaches, delicious Mediterranian cuisine and laidback lifestyle, Barcelona is also a haven for lovers of dynamic architecture and Modernist history. You'll explore the Modernist influence of famed architect Antoni Gaudi on this incredible city and learn about him, his life, his work and his predecessors. Starting in Plaza Catalunya, one of the biggest plazas in Spain, you'll first walk along the most iconic street of Barcelona, learning about the Passeig de Gracia district and mingling with the locals. See the famous food market and dip into Barcelona's bustling food culture, before seeing some local architectural jewels like Mercado El Nacional, Casa Amatller and Rambla de Gaudi. Learn what Modernism meant for Barcelona as you see the incredible Casa Batll� , maybe the most famous house in the city, and learn about Gaudi's life in Spain in the late 1800s to the early 1900s. Known as the greatest exponent of Catalan Modernism, his works have a highly individualised style, which you'll witness in his works throughout the city. See Casa Mila, known as La Pedrera for its rough unconventional aesthetic, and bask in the individuality of the last private residence designed by Gaudi. Hop on the metro as the locals do to Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's most well-known work and a city icon. Enter his universe as you walk the base of the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world and immerse yourself in history and local culture at this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Take it all in, take plenty of photos and then head to the leafy Rambla district for a relaxing stroll. Stop for a drink at a local, family-owned bar and because no tour of Barcelona would be complete without indulging in some local food, you'll also be treated to tapa. As you toast to your adventure, you'll come to realise why Spanish culture is so heavily focused on its food. End it all at the picturesque Hospital de San Pau, a beautiful example of Modernist architecture built between 1901 and 1930 by Lluis Domenech i Montaner. This is Barcelona!

Absorb all that sociopolitical history before taking a short walk to Strada Batistei, formerly known as the 'St Germain' of Bucharest and the site of the old American embassy, now an overgrown testament to different times. This area is famed for its 19th-century Neo Romanian architecture that defines much of the national style.� We'll then make your way to the Armenian quarter. The Armenians were a vibrant and successful merchant community in the 18th and 19th centuries, thanks to their valuable role as 'middlemen' for the Ottomans. Based around the Armenian church, their�mahalla�(neighborhood) features a spectacular variety of architectural styles from all over Europe and the Ottoman empire, as the wealthy merchants strove to out-do each other in taste and elegance. Classical, Belle �poque, Modernist, New-Romanian, Balkanic, eclectic � this quarter boasts all these styles, including the oldest documented house in Bucharest, which you will visit. � After, we'll experience the quintessential Bucharest public transport: a short ride on a tram. Rattling along the famous Mosilor Street, you�ll enter into Communist Bucharest, with its regimented blocks and housing projects, as you make your way to the famous Obor Market. This market is the largest and most famous of all the peasant markets in Bucharest, offering every kind of item, food, or service you could imagine, and even some that you couldn�t! � Since you�ll be on the trail of the sights, scents, and tastes of Romanian cuisine, we�ll stop just before the market for a drink of traditional Romanian�tuica�(brandy) to prepare the palate. But the drink almost never comes alone in a Romanian household. That's why we'll accompany it by a truly traditional ""peasant platter"" and we do hope that you brought your appetite with you because on it you'll find: 4 staple Romanian dips:?aubergine, zacusca, whipped beans and fish roe, fresh and matured cheeses (telemea and burduf), cracklings (yum!), sausages, smoked bacon, red onions, tomatoes, toast.??And, of course a glass of local beer or wine or soft drink. Next, after such a big introduction into Romanian cuisine, we'll stretch our legs a bit and?we�ll enter the indoor market?proper?to sample a range of Romanian cheeses: cow, sheep, and goat.?After that, it�s on to the vegetable market, amid a riot of colors and textures, to taste and photograph the fresh,?and more importantly seasonal,? local produce: wild strawberries and wild garlic in spring, spicy pickles in winter, juicy watermelon in summer or table grapes in the fall.� Probably the most famous and typical of Romanian foods � at least for Romanians � is called�mici, which translates as 'little.'� A kind of skinless sausage, these are served with mustard and cold beer, and every Romanian has their own opinion about where and how the best ones are made. But certainly the stall in Obor Market has been known for more than 50 years as one of the temples of�mici, and here you will get to try them for yourself!�And finally, because your gastronomic adventure would not be complete without a dessert, you grab a sweet Wallachian doughnut, served piping hot, before sending you happily on your way home.��

It was from here in 1989 that dictator Ceausescu made his ill-advised rallying speech to a crowd that quickly turned on him, instigating the Romanian revolution. Surrounding the square are several other notable landmarks, including the former Royal Palace, the Athenaeum concert hall, and Athenee Palace, the heart of espionage and intrigue in the years between the wars.� And in such a historical spot, it�s appropriate that we have a historical treat. We�ll indulge in a covrig, a daily salty snack for most Romanians that was likely introduced by Hapsburg or German merchants in medieval times.
Next up, we�ll leave the square and head south along Victory Street, named after the spectacular victory of the new Romanian nation in the 1877 War of Independence.� However, full unification of the three Romanian principalities did not take place until 1918, which explains why each region has its own distinct character, traditions, and cuisine � like sweet for Moldova, earthy for Transylvania, and spicy for Muntenia.� This stretch is also home to many spectacular landmarks of the inter-war period, including the 'Telephone Palace,' Military Circle, and former National Theatre, as well as the beautiful church of Kretzulescu, one of the most famous in Bucharest.� From Victory Street, we�ll head into an older Bucharest, exploring the numerous paths and passageways of the Old Town. This is the heart of medieval Bucharest, the literal crossroads between East and West, where Ottoman pashas rubbed shoulders with Transylvanian princes, and churches and mosques stood side by side. Here you can witness the many diverse influences on Romanian food � the Balkan mici (skinless sausages), the Ottoman sarmale (stuffed cabbage leaves), Russian borscht and ciorba (sour soups), and Austro-Hungarian schnitzel. Among the many sights and stories of Old Town are lavish interiors and princely courts, the exquisite calm of an orthodox monastery and the great wooden inn of Hanul Lui Manuc.� En route to our final destination, we�ll get a look at the famed People's Palace, the centre of Ceausescu�s megalomaniac attempts to re-shape the city, and the second largest building in the world (only the Pentagon is bigger!).
Finally, our Bucharest tour will end with a sampling of the culinary specialties at a traditional hanu, or inn, that�s widely considered to be one of the most beautiful in the city.� You�ll dig into a three-course meal with platters of local delicacies � giving you a 'taste tour' of the history and geography of the region.� It was said that during the time of the ancient Romanians (the Dacians), so much wine was drunk by the people that their leader, Burebista, banned its production entirely. But the supremely inventive Dacians immediately began brewing beer � thus, you�ll have a chance to lubricate your palate with both fine Romanian wines and/or locally brewed beer, just like the Dacians would have wanted!

Did you ever think it would be possible to visit Westeros and Essos in the same day? Well in Dubrovnik it is! This unique Game of Thrones tour will allow you to relive some of the most memorable moments from the revered HBO TV series as you explore beautiful Dubrovnik with a local by your side.,"Explore King's Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms, with an expert local guide

Your Game of Thrones adventure will begin at the Plo?e Gate, where Cercei�s ordeal came to an end and your journey has only just begun... We shall take Cercei�s path of shame and walk along St. Dominic Street. Step by step we�ll walk in Cercei�s footsteps to the Jesuit steps where her infamous nude walk of shame was filmed in Season 5. As we walk, we�ll see the Rector�s Palace, which is where Daenerys asked the Spice King for ships to go to Westeros. This is one of the few scenes that were filmed with fan favourite Daenerys in Dubrovnik and you will have the opportunity to see the location with us! The Jesuit Steps are a baroque staircase that lead up to the stunning Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola and this is where Cercei�s walk began. The local authorities initially blocked the shooting of the scene on the grounds that it was indecent but later gave the producers the go ahead. � Next, we�ll take a quick detour to visit a quirky souvenir shop where you can sit in an Iron Throne replica and get some great shots to show the grandkids! Our walk will take us back to Pile Gate, one of the main entrances to the Old Town. Many scenes were filmed here, from seasons 2 to 5. First we�ll show you where Joffrey was attacked by his own people, where Sansa tried to escape and where Jamie returned to King�s Landing. We'll visit the small park beneath the bridge and your guide will hook you up with insider stories about what the cast and crew get up to while they�re in town! Then we�ll take a slow walk to the port of King�s Landing, where Sansa watched the ships pass by, dreaming about her escape. Again you�ll see first hand the technical wizardry that HBO applied in the show to create its dream (or nightmare) like landscape and what Dubrovnik actually looks alike. Our last stop involves a short climb to Fort Lovrijenac, a magnificent 16th century fort that you will know as the Red Keep, which features prominently on the show. You will be amazed by the technology that HBO uses to create the Red Keep, it is truly astonishing! The fort itself has a fascinating history that is almost as good as a Game of Thrones storyline, offering spectacular views of the city and the rocky coastline. We�ll spend some time here, walking around, taking photos and doing our best King Joffrey impressions. Our tour ends here but before you go, don�t forget to tap up your guide for all the latest goings on in the city plus restaurant recommendations too. And remember, �when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die� or in our case, you have the Best. Day. Ever!

You�ll start your walking tour in front of the Centre Pompidou - Europe's largest modern art museum. Meet your local expert guide and then move to the H�tel de Ville passing the Stravinsky Fountain and some local street art along the way. This building acts as the city�s town hall, located on the square where public executions were once carried out.

As you pass by churches and historic monuments, you�ll also see rainbow boardwalks and how art and freedom also thrive here! This area is known for its open LGBTQIA+ community and Pride always passes by here. Visit the Saint Gervais church just behind the square, getting a glimpse of the beautiful inside interiors, then wander along the little streets of Marais to spot some old medieval churches and corbelled houses dating back to the Middle Ages. Then it�s time to fuel up with a sweet treat. You�ll be treated to something a little different � a delicious meringue known as a �merveilleux.�

Then it�s on to the Rue des Rosiers � the heart of the Jewish community in Paris. It�s a vibrant pedestrian street full of falafel stands and popular Jewish-influenced delis. Learn a bit about the history and culture of the community here, then head along the Rue de Rivoli to Hotel de Sully, once a hotel particulier (a former private residence of the aristocracy that�s now owned by the State). Pass by the court and the hidden gardens, which are kept open for the public but are often overlooked by tourists, making the area a peaceful oasis.

From the back of the gardens, follow a passage that takes you to Paris� oldest and most beautiful square, la Place des Vosges, home of France�s national writer, Victor Hugo. From there, it�s only a short walk to our final destination, La Place de la Bastille. This is a former prison that was captured on July 14, 1789, triggering the French Revolution.

Locals believe Split is the prettiest place on Earth. Tip: If you share their admiration towards Split, they are welcoming and polite to you. But if you don't like their Split, they will not like you. Simple as that.

The town is more than 1700 years old, founded within the walls of the Roman Palace. The Palace was built by one of the most interesting Roman emperors, the emperor Diocletian. Hence the name The Diocletian Palace. Walking the streets of the Palace in our small groups is one of the best ways we show respect to the residents and their history. Their ancestors inhabited the Palace area more than 1000 years ago creating an incredible blend of antique, medieval, and modern architecture combined with unique and vibrant living conditions and rituals locals still treasure.

Joining our tour is the best introduction to the everyday life of Spli?ana (the people of Split). Walking around with our local guides, born and raised in Split, you will have the honor to walk the same path as Roman emperor Diocletian walked. It is no secret, however, that the way to a Dalmatian�s heart is through the stomach so one of the first stops will be the famous Green Market of Split. You will stop at the Greenmarket to meet some local vendors, and our guides will share their knowledge of the way locals buy at the Greenmarket. Walk around to see, hear and taste the beauty of Split. Let the local guides show you traditional and authentic food and share the stories behind it. You can make a wish at the golden toe of Gregory of Nin (Grgur Ninski), hear about majestic Hajduk, Split, and why you see this name everywhere, from the suburbs of Split to the old town area.

Continue your royal adventure in the not-so-modest home of the emperor Diocletian. His colossal palace is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Monument and home to many but also a popular hangout for locals of Split and the cast of The Game of Thrones. As we wander into the heart of the city, Peristil, we�ll discover the secrets of Diocletian�s life hidden in the walls of the world�s best-preserved Roman palace � find out why he loved the salad so much and why a piece of the mythical White Stone can make you happy. We�ll finish our tour on the Riva promenade leaving you feeling as satisfied and pampered as the emperor Diocletian himself. Our local guides will point you to their favourite coffee shops and the best spots for an evening of Dalmatian delicacies and entertainment.

Tips/gratuities for your guide","Jasomirgottstra�e 3-5, at the Wine&Co�Flagship store, 1010 Vienna","Stephansplatz, 1010 Wien, St. Stephen�s Cathedral, in front of the main cathedral entrance","We begin our Vienna tour on one of the most famous and attractive shopping streets in the city: The Graben. Home of the court jeweler Heldwein and the famous porcelain factory of Augarten, the area is littered with imperial architecture, opulent coffee shops, and first-rate eateries.

It would be rude of us not to offer you a coffee and a light breakfast before getting started properly. So, after our brief stroll, we will stop for a quick coffee, strudel but not at one of the famous cafes, because only tourists go there. Instead, we will head to one of the few cafes that locals still visit in the first, a proper and still functioning �Kulturcafe�.

To Nasch means �to nibble� and that is exactly what one could do at the Naschmarkt, easily one of Europe�s best open-air markets. It is a mile long and showcases over 120 food stalls and some delectable restaurants that are cooking up some of the best food in the city. Here you will find the most diverse array of fruits, vegetables, and delicacies that are available in Vienna from all over the world.

While the Naschmarkt is a must-see, any local will tell you that they rarely pay it a visit, unless they fancy fighting out with tourists for the vendor�s attention. Instead every local has their own market that they like to visit, these may not be as big as the Naschmarkt, but they are certainly more lively and less touristy.

To that end, you will be whisked away from the Naschmarkt to a real �functioning� Viennese market. Whether that be the trendy Brunnenmarkt in the 16th with its cafes and creative, the lively Viktor�Adler�Markt in the traditionally working-class 10th or even the peaceful farmers market at Karmeliterplatz in the 2nd will depend on the day and the guide. But don�t be afraid to ask for directions from the others, there is never enough time in a day, let alone in a tour to visit everything! At our first local market, we will enjoy our first lunch where we will indulge in wonderful typical Austrian food (schnitzel, goulash, or a vegetarian option for example) and wash it down with locally produced wine or beer. We will also show you the sweet side of Vienna and treat you to the chef's best dessert.

Irrelevant of the market, one thing we can promise is that there will be food. Our guides will introduce you to some Viennese guilty pleasures, both sweet and savory, and life on the streets that no guidebook would ever mention. Pausing to take in Wurstelstand life offers you the chance to taste Austrian�s favorite dish (Hint: it�s not schnitzel).

All along the way, we will sink into the famed Viennese coffee culture. Coffeehouses have played a very important role in shaping the culture of the city over the centuries, with the first cup being brewed all the way back in 1683. The Austrian Inventory of Cultural Heritage describes coffeehouses as places �where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill.� We will show you where to find a wonderful cup of coffee or tea, or whatever your heart desires after a wonderful day of food. What does coffee pair the best with?

Our introduction to Vienna�s food and drink scene ends back in the city center, in front of the Opera house, the perfect springboard location to head off to any number of recommendations our guides will give you. Or you may simply wish to retreat for a cheeky nap back at your hotel if so, your guide can help you with directions.

Home of the court jeweler Heldwein and the famous porcelain factory of Augarten, the area is littered with imperial architecture, opulent coffee shops, and first-rate eateries.

It would be rude of us not to offer you a coffee and a light breakfast before getting started properly. So, after our brief stroll, we will stop for a quick coffee, strudel but not at one of the famous cafes, because only tourists go there. Instead, we will head to one of the few cafes that locals still visit in the first, a proper and still functioning �Kulturcafe�.

To Nasch means �to nibble� and that is exactly what one could do at the Naschmarkt, easily one of Europe�s best open-air markets. It is a mile long and showcases over 120 food stalls and some delectable restaurants that are cooking up some of the best food in the city. Here you will find the most diverse array of fruits, vegetables, and delicacies that are available in Vienna from all over the world.

While the Naschmarkt is a must-see, any local will tell you that they rarely pay it a visit, unless they fancy fighting out with tourists for the vendor�s attention. Instead every local has their own market that they like to visit, these may not be as big as the Naschmarkt, but they are certainly more lively and less touristy.

To that end, you will be whisked away from the Naschmarkt to a real �functioning� Viennese market. Whether that be the trendy Brunnenmarkt in the 16th with its cafes and creative, the lively Viktor�Adler�Markt in the traditionally working-class 10th or even the peaceful farmers market at Karmeliterplatz in the 2nd will depend on the day and the guide. But don�t be afraid to ask for directions from the others, there is never enough time in a day, let alone in a tour to visit everything! At our first local market, we will enjoy our first lunch where we will indulge in wonderful typical Austrian food (schnitzel, goulash, or a vegetarian option for example) and wash it down with locally produced wine or beer. We will also show you the sweet side of Vienna and treat you to the chef's best dessert.

Irrelevant of the market, one thing we can promise is that there will be food. Our guides will introduce you to some Viennese guilty pleasures, both sweet and savory, and life on the streets that no guidebook would ever mention. Pausing to take in Wurstelstand life offers you the chance to taste Austrian�s favorite dish (Hint: it�s not schnitzel).

All along the way, we will sink into the famed Viennese coffee culture. Coffeehouses have played a very important role in shaping the culture of the city over the centuries, with the first cup being brewed all the way back in 1683. The Austrian Inventory of Cultural Heritage describes coffeehouses as places �where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill.� We will show you where to find a wonderful cup of coffee or tea, or whatever your heart desires after a wonderful day of food. What does coffee pair the best with?

Our introduction to Vienna�s food and drink scene ends back in the city center, in front of the Opera house, the perfect springboard location to head off to any number of recommendations our guides will give you. Or you may simply wish to retreat for a cheeky nap back at your hotel if so, your guide can help you with directions.

Locals and visitors alike appreciate the beauty of these fields as they change seasons, from planting to harvest, and they offer up a serene, peaceful sight far removed from the bustling beaches of Bali�s tourist zones. Our Bali tour will whisk you away from the tourist track and introduce you to real local life: on the rice terraces of Kerobokan that define the country�s agricultural industry. Your guide will explain how the?subak?irrigation system works � it�s an ancient irrigation system, having first been introduced by Hindu priests when they arrived on Bali over 1,200 years ago, but is still very much in use today. The?subak?system is about so much more than just watering plants, though. It creates ecosystems for new life, and is bound by the community�s temples, where water priests honour the relationship between humans, the Earth, and the gods.� You�ll learn more about this relationship with a visit to a local?subak?temple, a gathering place for farmers. We�ll walk from here into the expansive rice fields of Kerobokan, where we�ll begin our trek of about two to three kilometres (wear comfy shoes that you don�t mind getting wet!).� We�ll make our way through the terraces, using the tops of walls as a pathway. We�ll cross over rivers, carefully treading over the farmers� bamboo bridges from one rice field to the next.� �The local farmers here don�t just grow rice, but also tomatoes, beans, bananas, eggplant, chilies, corn, sugar cane, and water snails. The rice fields themselves are home to�a number of�aquatic species, including frogs, fish, crabs, and snails � it�s the perfect little ecosystem, and you�ll have a better understanding of how it all works together.� After our trek, we�ll�end our trip at a small caf� and drink some fresh coconut water.� Need a taxi to get to the meeting point? Our local guides in Bali recommend the?Blue Bird taxi app?as the easiest way to get around.� � �","This tour supports farmers in the Kerobokan area by donating a portion of your tour fee to a local farmer�s cooperative. During the visit to the temple, your guide will explain how the co-op works across the rice fields, the intricate workings of the 1,000-year-old subak irrigation system, and its importance to the community.","For shared tours, the maximum group number will be 12 passengers.

For those with a sweet tooth, may try 'Jasuke' � sweet steamed corn with condensed milk and shredded cheese awaits, or relish the savory delight of 'Martabak Telur,' a traditional fried pancake.

Post-feast, take a leisurely stroll along the heritage street, discovering a church adorned with traditional Balinese architecture and the Hindu Temple of Pura Agung Jagatnatha. Pause at Puputan Square, a historic battleground against colonialism in 1906, and stand at the 0 km mark � the heart of Bali Island.

Continue westward to encounter the Nederlandsch-Indi� Sokkelklok, a colonial-era clock monument, and the Catur Muka, a four-faced god monument at the intersection. Conclude your walking tour at an antique coffee shop, where authentic Indonesian Arabica Coffee, hot or cold, rejuvenates your senses.

Despite the richness of your experience, the affordability of the culinary delights allows you to bring home extra treats at a mere USD$1-2 per item.

Your guide (now your best foodie friend on Bali) will assist you with finding a taxi for your trip back to your hotel (or to the next stop for your day out).

Explore some famous landmarks as well as hidden gems on this Bangkok day tour that takes you through the city by boat and on foot. You�ll begin this Bangkok tour by walking to the pier, where you�ll board a longtail boat down the Chao Phraya River, also known as the River of Kings. The name of the river perfectly reflects this part of the tour; you�ll feel like royalty on your relaxing journey! This river is also the reason why Bangkok is known as the �Venice of the East,� and you�ll explore this nickname further as you glide through the network of khlongs, or canals. Many of the khlongs have been filled in over the years and converted into roads. These roads have turned into little Thai communities, and as you swoop through the waters you�ll discover insights into these neighbourhoods. This area of Bangkok feels like a world away from the busy streets and chaos, and a welcome break from the bustling city centre!

You�ll continue by heading over to the Grand Palace. Strolling through the palace grounds feels like walking through an Asian version of Alice in Wonderland ��the buildings are so beautiful they almost don�t feel real. But bet your bottom dollar, they�re real alright! Your local guide will tell you all about the history behind the palace and the most sacred Buddhist temple in Thailand, Wat Phra Kaew. This place is considered to be the spiritual centre of the nation, making it a visit that you cannot afford to miss.

From one beautiful temple to another, you�ll move on to Wat Pho, another temple that is integral to the Buddhist religion in Thailand. It�s home to the famous golden reclining Buddha and is the birthplace of traditional Thai massage. This is one of the most popular things to do in Bangkok, and with our local guide to take your through the temples, you�ll hear all the secret stories and local knowledge about the place.

Your tour will finish up at Wat Pho, from where you can continue to explore, or your local guide will be happy to give you directions back to your accommodation. This tour shows you a truly unique side of the city that you won�t find on any of the other day tours in Bangkok, and it gives you the opportunity to visit both famous sights and hidden spots, exploring them through the eyes of a local. �

Please note that this tour covers 5 km of Boat Ride and 1.5 km (1 mile) of walking.

Special information: When visiting the Grand Palace, you�ll be required to wear clothes covering your shoulders and knees (long pants or skirts are suitable) plus covered shoes/sneakers (no sandals).",This tour hires local longtail boatmen who own their own boats directly. These boatmen rely on tourism to supplement their income as modern transport routes mean fewer locals need to use their boats.,"For shared tours, the maximum group number will be 12 passengers. For private tours, there must be a minimum of 2 passengers.

Wangmai, Pathum Wan, Bangkok.","The Damnoen Saduak floating market is one of the most popular sites to see in Thailand and for good reason! Some�call this area the Venice of the East, where vendors sell their goods from boats and stalls set up along the water's edge of this unique market. In the mid-1800s, to help locals journeying between towns, Thai King Rama IV and his son, King Rama V, commissioned a 32-kilometer canal connecting two rivers together: the Mae Krong river and Tha Cheen River. The name of this man-made canal is Damnoen Saduak, which means ""convenience journey"" in Thai.

You'll start your private tour with a drive-by private vehicle to the railway market, about two hours from Bangkok. Please be on time for your tour! We'll need to leave at�6:30 am�sharp or you'll miss the excitement at the surreal railway market. And trust us, you need to see it to believe it! Vendors set up their goods along active railway tracks, with fresh produce, fabrics, cooking supplies, and more all lined up a mere few inches from the track's edge (and in some cases, right on top of the tracks).

You'll get to see what happens when the train comes through: vendors gather up their things and lower their canopies, and both vendors and shoppers step aside as the train travels right through the middle of the market. Once the train leaves, business resumes as though nothing had disrupted them! Between the train schedule, your guide will lead you around the market and introduce you to traditional Thai foods, from desserts to snacks to fresh fruits.�

We'll then continue on a short drive to a palm sugar plantation, where we'll visit the house of a villager who still makes palm sugar the traditional way. There are a lot of coconut palm tree plantations in Thailand, and the local wisdom of making organic palm sugar from the nectar of coconut flowers has been passed down from generation to generation.

Onward, we'll board a small boat for a ride through narrow village canals, to reach the famous floating market of Damnoen Saduak�� keep your camera ready as this place is a non-stop photo op. If anything catches your eye along your boat ride, let your guide know and you can stop to chat with vendors and purchase something to take home (or to eat right there!). We'll then depart the boat and walk around to explore more of the market. You'll find a variety of Thai foods, such as seasonal tropical fruits from local orchards, as well as souvenirs, all available on both river banks. Around noon, we'll head back to Bangkok and return near BTS (Skytrain) station National Stadium. Your local guide will be happy to give you directions back to your accommodation or�to other sites you should see.","Instead of visiting one of the many palm sugar plantations that have been set up for tourists to see and learn about the process, we visit a local family at their village plantation where they make palm sugar daily throughout the year. The family has been here for generations and bringing our small groups provides some additional income for them.",The private tour is priced for a minimum group size of two travellers.

Hop on a cycle rickshaw (10 min ride), one of the most colourful methods of transportation in Delhi, and pass through the city�s picturesque colleges and universities, stopping at an ancient Hanuman temple. After visiting the temple, we head out to our first food stop and witness how fresh local shawarma (kebab) is made. From here, we�ll continue on to an iconic neighbourhood eatery that is popular with everyone, including students from nearby colleges. Here, you can enjoy a local favourite � fresh fruit beer � as well as momos (dumplings) and banta, a delicious lemon-based drink that�s an ideal refreshment for hot Delhi weather. We then continue through the Kamla Market and emerge into a narrow alley full of delectable street food joints. This lane is a great spot for photographers and food lovers alike, and here�s where we�ll sample several local delicacies like golgappas and bhelpuri. Yum! After sampling nearly everything we possibly can, walk it off through some beautiful nearby markets, admiring everything including the work of a local henna painter. Just when you didn�t think it possible, we�ll find more food! Sample some crispy potatoes, pao bhajji, and stop for the best homemade ice cream in Delhi, kulfi-falooda.

Start the city tour with a visit to the Temple of Literature.�Originally built in honour of Confucius by�King�Ly�Thai�Thong in 1070, a university was added to the grounds six years later. The university provided education to the royal family and children of the aristocracy or ""mandarins"".

For this HCMC tour, leave the hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh City to explore one of the relics from one of the most significant local historical events in recent memory. Journey 2 hours west towards the Cambodian border and arrive at the Cu Chi tunnels. The location of the tunnels was of significant strategic importance: they're at the end of the infamous Ho Chi Minh Trail, and within striking distance of the southern Vietnam capital. Initial construction started in 1948 when the Viet Minh required somewhere to hide from French air attacks, and by 1965, the tunnel complex was estimated to consist of 200 km of tunnels. It included, hospitals, schools, meeting rooms, kitchens, and sleeping quarters. Life was difficult for the inhabitants, and to protect against outside intruders, booby traps were laid throughout the complex. Today, the Vietnamese government have preserved approximately 75 km of the Cu Chi tunnels as a memorial park, and in some areas the tunnels have been widened and low powered lights installed so that tourists can now fit through the complex.

Your local guide will take you on a fascinating tour of the Cu Chi tunnels, where you'll learn more about the conditions the people lived in, the hardships they faced, and the amazing ingenuity employed to maintain life in the tunnels. We walk past huge bomb craters - evidence of the heavy bombing campaigns in the region during the Indochina conflict, discover hidden entrances right beneath your feet, wander past tiny little chimneys in the ground that dispersed smoke from the underground kitchens, sample some of the simple cuisines that local fighters would have survived on, and have an opportunity to venture into the tunnels and explore the complex.

After exploring the Cu Chi Tunnel, you will enjoy a local sandwich on the way back to Ho Chi Minh City. You'll end this historical Ho Chi Minh City tour with a greater understanding of the local impacts of the conflicts of the 20th century.

Please note that this tour covers 1.5 km (1 mile) of walking.","By visiting and paying an entrance fee to Cu Chi tunnels, this tour helps preserve the local historical heritage.","For shared tours, the maximum group number will be 12 passengers.

About 2.5 hours away is the city of My Tho, a former naval base that is now a bustling port city in the Mekong Delta. The area is the final destination of the mighty Mekong River, which winds its way from Tibet, through China, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, and finally into Vietnam. An incredibly fertile region, the Mekong Delta's prime industry is food production, producing approximately half of Vietnam's total agricultural output. Local life for villages in the area revolves around the rivers and canals that make up the delta, so much so that people are more likely to transport by river than road.

Upon arrival into My Tho, we board our private boat for a cruise on the Mekong River. Our first stop is at a fish farm, to gain an insight into one of the cottage industries in the region. On our Mekong tour, we'll visit an island with lush tropical gardens where we have a chance to sample tropical fruit.

Continuing to another island in the Mekong Delta, we'll learn more about another cottage industry, coconut candy. Your local guide will take you to a factory and explain the process of making the sweet.

As we meander down the Mekong, we'll have a chance to visit local villages in the area and learn more about the traditional lifestyles, culture, and customs of people who call the Delta their home.

Continuing on our Mekong discover, we'll travel by Xe Loi (motorised cart), and visit a bee farm, from where we'll transfer to a smaller rowing boat to help us get deeper into the smaller canals of the Delta.

For lunch, we'll hit up Vuon Dau restaurant, where your local guide will provide you with some advice on the finer points of local cuisine and assist with ordering some of these delicacies. After lunch, our Ho Chi Minh City river tour will come to an end, and we'll head back to My Tho for the journey back to Ho Chi Minh City where you will be dropped off at your hotel.

Put your eating pants on and follow us!�

Our Saigon food tour kicks off with some authentic local appetizers such as chao muc (a dry squid porridge) and xa xui (Cantonese barbecued pork). Learn how Chinese food has been integrated into Vietnamese cuisine as you inhale the spicy flavours of the street stalls and watch local life unfold before your eyes in the heart of Saigon.

Our immersion into local life continues as we make our way to the corner of Nguyen Cong Tru and Calmette for a unique street food called banh bo banh tieu, which recalls memories of many Saigoneses� childhoods. This spot is also a good place to learn about Calmette and Yersin, the two disciples of Pasteur who greatly contributed to the health health system in Vietnam. The Pasteur Institute in Saigon is the first one outside of France, and was set up by Calmette, and the one in Nha Trang was started by Yersin � who was also the founder of the University of Medicine of Hanoi and discovered the bacteria that causes Black Death. This is why these three names are among the last remaining French names in HCMC.

On the way to our next food stop, we will pass by Chua Ba Thien Hau, which means the Goddess of the Sea. This former Chinese community house honours Chinese immigration to Saigon through the different periods of Cantonese, Teochew and Hakka. It wouldn�t be a true local experience without enjoying coffee the way Saigonese coffee aficionados do on a daily basis. We�ll head to a popular local�gem�of Saigon to enjoy a cup. We�ll show you the local style of taking your coffee and you�ll feel right at home!

Next up on our Saigon food adventure is another one of the city�s iconic street food dishes: bo cuon mo chai (barbecued beef meatballs) and fried�rice flour cake with egg. These dishes are some of the most popular and preferred dishes by southerners, and you can find them everywhere, from street stalls to fancy restaurants. What makes them so beloved is that the ingredients are so strikingly simple, yet the tastes and flavours are truly unforgettable (we promise).

We�ll cap off our Saigon street food tour with, what else, street beer! At this street beer stall, we�ll outfit you with a cold Saigon beer�with�peanuts and rice crackers�and taste some deep-fried�tofu with lemongrass or salted egg yolk with green chili.�This is a�great�chance to mingle with locals�� not a bad way to end the evening is it?!

Journey in the footsteps of the city's most famous ruler and conquer Istanbul in just a day. This is the ultimate all-in-one introduction to the sites everyone must-see in Istanbul, with a locals-know twist. Visit Turkey's iconic UNESCO-listed historic spots such as the jaw-dropping Hagia Sophia, the beautiful Blue Mosque, and the pretty, tree-lined ancient Hippodrome, and learn how Istanbul has stood strong through the centuries. Eat a tasty Turkish lunch with locals at a hidden restaurant, then listen to stories of how generations of sultans lived at the grand Topkapi Palace, overlooking the gorgeous Bosphorus Strait. Finish it all off with a backstreet tour and some good-natured haggling with local artisans in the Grand Bazaar.","Visit the mesmerising ancient site of Hagia Sophia and marvel at this 1,500-year-old masterpiece of Byzantine history

We�re certainly going to try! Take a journey from Byzantium to Constantinople to Sultan Mehmet Fatih�s city of Islam on this historical tour that stops at some of the most iconic sites in Turkey while also showing you the city�s exciting present.

Start your Istanbul tour with a dose of awe at Justinian the Great�s Hagia Sophia. This masterpiece of Byzantine architecture stands tall and proud in downtown Istanbul, holding within its walls more than 1,500 years of Turkish history. This mind-bogglingly beautiful site is also somewhat of a chameleon � it has lived its long life as a church, a mosque, and now as a museum. It�s also a movie star: anyone who�s seen From Russia with Love will feel a bit like James Bond when they step inside. You�ll then head just across the street to the jewel in the Istanbul crown. Sultan Ahmet I�s Blue Mosque is one of the most striking sights in Istanbul, with its iconic blue-tiled walls (the tiles number in the tens of thousands!), 260 windows, and six minarets. Don�t forget to ask your guide the significance of those six spires.

Next, your Istanbul city tour will take you to the ancient Hippodrome. Today, this charming promenade is a popular meeting point for Istanbulites, but it is also an integral part of Turkish history. Chariot races once took place along this strip, which was also home to the notorious Nika riots � a dramatic political protest in 532 AD that led to the massacre of tens of thousands of people.

Need a break? We�ll step back to the present and join the locals as we lunch in a hidden caf�. You�ll enjoy friendly conversation with members of the community and learn about daily life in Istanbul. Once you�re filled with Turkish cuisine, Topkapi Palace awaits. This opulent complex overlooking the Bosphorus is a true Istanbul treasure, with many colourful stories about the rich sultans who lived there between 1453 and 1839.

Lastly, you�ll seek out treasures of a different kind in Istanbul�s famed Grand Bazaar, which offers up 3,000 shops to explore along 61 streets. Meet a few of the local characters, perfect your haggling skills, have a true Turkish coffee, and shop till you drop.
Note that the Grand Bazaar is closed on Sundays, so if you choose a Sunday departure, you�ll explore the nearby vibrant Spice Market, filled with delectable and colourful Turkish spices, treats, coffees, and teas.

We will start by wandering through Tsukiji�s market, which is brimming with vibrant food stalls and retail shops. This is the place to be if you�re looking for the freshest and dare we say, most delicious sushi breakfast one could ever hope for! The wholesale portion of the market where the famous tuna auction takes place has moved from the original Tsukiji site, a few kilometres across the water to Toyosu, but Tsukiji still is the best place to check and try all the products sold in Toyosu. With over 2,500 tons and 450 types of fish coming through the wholesale market every day, you�re bound to come across some foods and fish you�ve never seen before. Squid jerky, anyone? Or perhaps omelette on a stick? No matter what kind of unusual snacks you may encounter, Tsukiji promises to be an experience for all five senses.

At each food stop, your guide will share the stories behind the ingredients, techniques, and traditions�like how ginger and wasabi enhance sushi, why dashi made from bonito flakes forms the base of Japanese cuisine, and how daifuku (mochi) expresses harmony through texture and simplicity. From rooftop terraces to stand-up sushi counters, this is Tokyo as locals live it: fast-paced, flavorful, and full of meaning.

During the tour we�ll take a step back into Japanese history and experience authentic Japanese culture by visiting impressive small shrine next to the fish market. As shrines are such a sacred place, observe locals before and after passing through a torii gate and learn the way to show respect before entering the main hall of the shrine yourself. Before you go off on your own, don�t forget to ask your local guide for additional tips on where else to visit during your stay in Tokyo.

We�ll explore food the way Tokyoites do�by grazing through the city: tasting, chatting, laughing, and learning. You�ll meet the people behind the counter, hear their stories, and get hands-on with comfort dishes like Monja-yaki and grilled skewers. The goal is not just to eat�but to experience.

We�ll kick off at the Depachika, the basement food floor of a department store. Explore a world of colorfully arranged dishes�from everyday side dishes to luxurious treats�and marvel at Japanese, Western, and Chinese desserts. Learn about Wagashi, seasonal Japanese sweets made from rice and red beans, inspired by nature�s forms. You�ll choose one Wagashi to try!

We may stop by Itoya, a beautifully curated stationery store founded in 1904, where Japan�s rich paper culture continues to thrive. Then we head to Tsukishima's �Monja Street�, home of Monja-yaki, Tokyo�s sizzling comfort food. Watch it grilled before your eyes, chat with the cook, and eat it fresh off the griddle with a metal spatula�just like the locals do.

Afterward, we return to Yurakucho where smoky skewers and cold beer await. We�ll enjoy a drink of sake or a local beer, then sample yakitori at one of the many local restaurants. Each shop has its own secret �tare� sauce and grilling style. You�ll get a chance to talk with yakitori chefs, learn about their craft, and even try making your own skewer. They pride themselves on sourcing quality meats and perfecting the smoky-charred balance.

Start your day by the dazzling marquee of the Chicago Theater, where you might recognise the neon sign from the popular musical movie 'Chicago!'

Our next stop is the Colorado State Capitol, constructed in the late 19th century and reminiscent of the United States Capital.

Meet your tour guide within Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre",Within Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre�,"First, a home to dinosaurs, then a settlement of local Indigenous people, before it became what it is best known for today: a temple of live music. Get started on your tour at the iconic Red Rocks Trading Post, where you�ll meet your guide and head up through the rocky road to the amphitheatre. Make a stop at the Spirit Statue of a guitar-strapped John Denver � just one of the music greats who have performed here over the years. Walk along a short section of the Trading Post Trail, passing various tilted rock formations, while your guide gives you a quick geology lesson. Learn about the dinosaurs who roamed Red Rocks over 150 million years ago, some leaving footprints behind which can be seen at the nearby Dinosaur Ridge. One of the excavated fossils found at this site was a 90-foot Apatosaurus ajax. The next significant point in the region�s history was its importance to the Indigenous Native American people. Your guide will discuss the Ute people, who were Colorado's first residents and used the area now known as Red Rock Park for ceremonial events. Keep walking along the trail, looking for the region�s critters, which are sometimes seen from the trail, before finally arriving at the amphitheatre. Architect Burnham Hoyt designed the site to maximise the naturally occurring acoustics of the rocky site while preserving the beauty. Finally opening in 1941, the stage has hosted names such as The Beatles, U2, Widespread Panic, John Denver, Stevie Nicks and even early opera stars like Lily Pons. Music lovers can get even more history about the many legends who�ve graced the Red Rocks stage on a visit to the Red Rocks Hall of Fame. Alongside the amphitheatre lies Ship Rock Grill, named after one of the giant rocks framing the theatre. This restaurant serves up a selection of local favourites. Refuel after your tour with a meal here or further into Morisson at another local joint, The Fort, but ask your guide for their favourite regional specialty. Your Red Rocks tour will come to an end but if you don�t want your Denver adventure to end, there�s a lot more fun to be had. Hikers may enjoy the views of Matthews/Winters Park or more of the trails within the Red Rocks Park. See dinosaur tracks at Dinosaur Ridge, enjoy the scenery on a drive through the Lariat Loop National Scenic Byway or ask your guide about things to do in the nearby town of Morrison.

It used to be that Cubans weren�t allowed to own their own businesses, but today, under new regulations, budding entrepreneurs are opening up shops in areas such as this alley. As we wander, you�ll hear the story of local man Papito, who is the founder of this particular community project. Once a barber, Papito was concerned about the at-risk youth in his neighbourhood and wanted to give them the means to make a living and stay out of trouble. So, he gave them the opportunity to become barbers and hairdressers, by creating a school for the community. We�ll visit his house, which is still a barber shop, but also a museum with an exhibit on traditional hair services. In addition to opening his school, Papito is also known for changing the face of �the ugliest street in Havana.� He encouraged his neighbours to help revitalise the alleyway by opening local private businesses that could bring revenue into the community. Papito recruited a popular young local artist, Yulier P., to paint the alleyway, featuring lots of artwork inspired by hairdressers. We�ll then hop into a taxi or private bus (depending on the size of our group) and head to the eye-popping Fusterlandia in the Jaimanitas neighbourhood. This community project is by a successful local artist, Jose Fuster, who began decorating the houses in his neighbourhood with pieces of ceramic tiles. The project began in the �90s, during a serious economic crisis in Cuba, and what started as a few tiles has turned into one of the most intricate mosaic displays you�ll see anywhere. Inspired by the Spanish muralist Gaudi, Fuster is today considered the �Cuban Picasso,� and the displays he has created at Fusterlandia are truly mind-bending � Instagram alert! You�ll get to hear Fuster�s story and visit his intricately designed mosaic house and art gallery, and perhaps even meet a member of his family. Lastly, we�ll drive to Muraleando in the Lawton neighbourhood. This cultural program features a group of local artists and is directed by Manuel Mario Diaz Baldrich, with different workshops and activities for children, teenagers and the elderly. Locals can sign up for sessions covering music, dance, theatre, painting, ceramics and sculpture out of recycled materials. Take a look around and you�ll find wall murals around the neighbourhood from locals and visiting artists � even a piece by �Peanuts� creator Charles Schulz! After touring the community with one of the residents, we�ll enjoy some live music by a local band along with a traditional Cuban lunch and a special local drink. Our tour will end back where we started, but before you go, be sure to ask your local guide for other tips on things to see and do in Havana.","Art is an important part of Cuban culture, and local artists have long used their works to express themselves amid political upheaval, economic struggles and cultural changes.

Our local English speaking guide will take you through the labyrinth of streets of one of the oldest cities in the Western Hemisphere, where you�ll discover the enchanting secrets of this living museum where residents live amongst the unique charm and haunting decay of buildings dating as far back as the 16th century. Havana is the largest city in the Caribbean and was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982. Restoration is occurring slowly, so while many of the main buildings are excellently restored to their original glory, others have taken on their own look by being left to age naturally, virtually neglected since the Revolution triumphed more than 50 years ago. This Old Havana walking tour works its way through an old part of Central Havana and then through to the heart of Old Havana. Along the way, you�ll get to take in some of the city�s most iconic sights, such as the Art Museum, Calle Obispo, Plaza de Armas, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza San Francisco de Asis, Plaza Vieja and the Hotel Ambos Mundos. Your Havana adventure will end with a delicious local Havana lunch in a caf� or restaurant and a refreshing cool drink in one of Old Havana�s most famous watering holes.","This tour helps promote local cultural heritage as you'll be exploring Old Havana, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
This tour also financially supports local, private businesses (versus state-owned), which is so important in Cuba. Supporting private businesses is a way to boost the local economy and keep money in the hands of hard-working locals. Your guide will also show the contrast between private and state-owned businesses for further context.
Your tour ends at a local, private restaurant where money spent is directly supporting the owners of the business and workers who are mostly young people who live in the community.","Shared tours accommodate a maximum of 12 passengers to maintain a high-quality group experience.

We will meet at the ""House of Tiles"" where we will take a public electric bus to the North Bus Station. The ride will take around 20 min. There we will need to wait for a bus (around 20 min) that will take us to the Pyramids. After 90 minutes of the countryside ride we�ll begin by experiencing the Teotihuacan Pyramids, �where the men become gods�. Walking through the Teotihuacan Pyramids is like taking a step back in time. We�ll begin our visit at the impressive Moon Pyramid, with a guided Teotihuacan tour to learn about the history, meaning, and architecture of one of the most representative icons of Latin America. Our exploration continues with a walk through the Calzada de los Muertos (Dead Pass) to reach the Sun Pyramid, which is the tallest and most spectacular in the area. Across the Pyramid of the Moon stands La Ciudadela (the Citadel), a large ceremonial courtyard that contains the Temple of Quetzalcoatl. After exploring the pyramids, we�ll take some time to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and capture photos of the stunning views. You�ll also have a chance to relax and reflect on the historical significance of this ancient site before we continue with our adventure. Following our pyramid visit, we�ll continue with a stroll through the streets of a local town and make two stops that will give you a deeper understanding of the local way of life outside the big cities. We will visit a local family and discover that cactus is an important cultural and historical symbol in Mexico. It might surprise you to learn that cactus is a staple in Mexican cuisine! The cherry on top of our big day will be lunch! We�ll be welcomed into a local family�s home to see how locals live outside Mexico City. Here, we�ll enjoy some real local flavours of typical Mexican kitchens served by one or two of the family members. For lunch you can expect a main meal: chicken with cactus, potatoes, rice, and tlacoyo. Products are straight from local organic farms. Delicious! After lunch, we�ll head back to Mexico City, happy, full, and enriched from our exciting day exploring local life, ancient pyramids, and delicious food!

Being such an important part of daily life, some markets have also become a showcase of politics and culture.

Your first stop on your Mexico City tour is a relatively unknown market that boasts a large art collection depicting the political movement from the first half of the 1900s. Your guide will explain the importance of the murals and bridge the gap between the political movement of that period with what is going on in today�s Mexico.

To reach our second market you�ll travel the city just like the locals do, by riding the public metro. This market boasts an unmatched selection of flowers � you�ll be mesmerised by the variety and by the vendors, who will be all too happy to help you match the perfect bouquet to your eye colour. You�ll also find fruits, herbs, meat, fish, pinatas, and more, all for sale among the various stalls � no matter what you�re shopping for, you�re in the right place. And that could even include romance! If you�re looking for love, you might even find a love potion available amid all the goods!

Along the way, you�ll also get to sample some classic Mexican street foods, such as tacos and tamales, along with a coffee or atole � a traditional warm drink made from masa. After buying some fresh vegetables (and learning about local farming practices), head over to a local family business, where you�ll learn how to prepare your own salsa. Together, you�ll wash, cut and grill the ingredients, then smash them in the traditional way, using a molcajete (mortar and pestle). Taste your homemade salsa with a classic huarache.

Rampart St., New Orleans, LA 70116",A central location around the French Quarter area,"Our music tour of New Orleans begins just outside the French Quarter at the historic and beautiful Louis Armstrong Park in the Trem� neighborhood. Within the park, we will talk about the historical origins of jazz and discuss one of the jazz greats, Armstrong himself. Starting underneath the park�s famed lighted arched entrance, we�ll explore the area originally known as Congo Square � one of the first locations in the city where enslaved people and free people of color were allowed to gather and socialize. You�ll hear about jazz�s origins, resulting from a rich mix of cultures in a single city, which combined West African and Caribbean sounds with European musical influences � giving us this uniquely American artform. From here, we will head into the Vieux Carre, or the French Quarter, and you�ll hear about the origins and culture of jazz while making your way through the oldest neighborhood in NOLA, all while seeing some notable historic sites. Your guide will have chosen a special route for you that evening- to ensure the best music is heard. Along one possible route, we�ll share the history of Bourbon Street and the residential and commercial places where blues and jazz collaborators came to make incredible music. We may pass by Preservation Hall, a venue that brought people of all backgrounds together, even in times of segregation. We may even catch a busker performing at the historic French Market! Or your guide may chose to head to the famous Frenchmen Street, the largest concentration of live music venues in the city. Whatever path is taken, you�ll find yourself at a great Jazz/Music Spot, and your guide will take you inside to listen and enjoy the local scene. Either way, by being with a local, you�ll learn all about the neighborhood, how to make the most of your time here, and the music culture and how it operates in the Clubs and venues. And to top it off, you will receive a drink on us at one of the stops and you�re very welcome to purchase additional beverages as and when you want them. In New Orleans, there�s always the opportunity for an element of surprise. We�ll be on the lookout for impromptu street performances, which always make the night special. If (well, let�s be honest, when!), at the end of the tour you're still craving more, your guide will point out other great recommendations for the rest of your evening!

Here, you'll learn how Broadway evolved from vaudeville houses and opera theatres to a global entertainment powerhouse. As you walk past historic venues like the New Amsterdam Theatre (once home to the Ziegfeld Follies), the Richard Rodgers Theatre (Hamilton), the Majestic, and the Shubert, you'll trace the timeline of Broadway's greatest triumphs and challenges�from the Golden Age musicals of the 1940s and 50s, through the near-collapse of the district in the 1970s, to its modern-day revival as a cultural and economic cornerstone of New York City. Leaving the bright marquees behind, the tour takes you deeper�into the hidden world that powers the stage. You�ll visit a professional theatre facility in the nearby Hell�s Kitchen neighborhood, where the real work of Broadway unfolds. Here, you'll gain insight into the lives of the people who make Broadway possible but are rarely seen by audiences: rehearsal studios, where performers spend countless hours perfecting their roles. You may even hear a rehearsal or class in session�actors warming up, choreography being run, or technical crews setting up for a future show. Throughout the tour, you'll hear personal stories and historical context about the craftspeople, stagehands, understudies, marketers, and creatives whose passion and tireless work keep the industry thriving. The tour ends back in Midtown Manhattan, just steps from where it began�but with an entirely new perspective. You�ll leave not only having seen Broadway�s iconic sights but having felt its heartbeat�powered by generations of people who have dedicated their lives to this extraordinary art form. This isn�t just a tour of theatres. It�s a tribute to the soul of Broadway.",,The maximum number of people on this tour will be 12 passengers.,"If you have any issues on the day of your tour, please call +1 857 294 0068",,Free cancellation up to 24 hours before activity.,,,,,USD,59,59,0,Art & Culture & History,,,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--ZddAoD9S--/v1744718402/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-Times-Square-Duffy-Square-group-2_rmxfjv.jpg?,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--SyfSfbgp--/v1732315421/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-Open-Jar-Studios-view-times-square-2_zhrubh.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--Pyc_Vy57--/v1732315475/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-theatres-07_ipvxtr.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--UIbSez5v--/v1732315070/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-theatres-01_vgasxf.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--dBhB7cYu--/v1732315590/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-theatres-02_uavskw.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--clwDxmVY--/v1732315505/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-Times-Square-Duffy-Square-group-3_d0tx8q.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--mLHwrCPq--/v1732315491/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-theatre-shop_h4azyf.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--71a4OfKc--/v1732315050/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-leader-and-group-1_chfi8j.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--gpGgR8BW--/v1732315095/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-Open-Jar-Studios-1_gccp3b.jpg,https://cdn.ventrata.com/image/upload/s--FSvfY1o2--/v1732315113/Urban-Adventures-USA-New-York-Broadway-Behind-the-Scenes-Experience-leader-and-group_ft9pc4.jpg,-,,,,,,,,,,,,

This two-and-a-half-hour walking tour of Seattle's Fremont neighbourhood is a fun, boozy adventure through art-laden streets, historical canals and fascinating local sights and landmarks. Try some enticing spirits and cocktails along the way and fall in love with this creative district. Start your tour by trying a couple of signature craft cocktails in the heart of Fremont � sometimes referred to as �The Artists� Republic of Fremont�, this bohemian neighbourhood on the north bank of the canal is known for its quirky outdoor art installations, groovy bars and eateries and locally run indie shops. As you learn why this area is referred to as �The Center of the Universe�, your tour might just take you under the nose of the enormous statue of Vladimir Lenin � your tour guide can explain how this rather unusual piece of art landed in the heart of Fremont and the controversy it has sparked over the years. During your walk, witness the channel of water that runs under the Aurora Bridge and spot the expansive Lake Union, which connects to Salmon Bay and Puget Sound via the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Your tour guide will fill you in on the history of the canal and its importance to the development of the Fremont neighbourhood. As you wind your way through these beautiful urban streets, be enticed by the historical building of the Theo Chocolate factory and fill your nose with the smells of cocoa. You might want to tour the chocolate factory and stock up on some delicious souvenirs before or after this tour. Check out some of the other curious art installations in the area, such as The Fremont Rocket and other space-themed installations and learn about their background. As you walk along the riverside trail, watch out for the rowers and kayakers passing you by, as you discover the local park. Culminate your experience with an array of tastings of different spirits, which are made right here in the Pacific Northwest! From various signs with advice like �set your watch back five minutes� and �throw your watch away�, to the general bohemian vibe of the district, you�ll soon find lots of reasons to fall in love with eccentric Fremont (cocktails aside!).

Join your local guide in the lively Seattle Center area by the Grass Blades sculpture, the first of the many art pieces you�ll see today. The Seattle Center is home to over 30 of Seattle�s organisations, including the Opera Center, Museum of Pop Culture, Climate Pledge Arena, Cornish Playhouse, Space Needle and more. Spend time with your guide exploring the complex. Pass by the Chihuly Glass and Garden, where a selection of American artist Dale Chihuly�s large-scale blown glass sculptures rise from the ground and hang from the air. Another eye-catching site you�ll come across is the wavy metallic walls of the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP). Designed by Frank Gehry, this building offers exhibits devoted to beloved pop culture phenomena, everything from science fiction and fantasy to local sports and music names like Nirvana. Keep walking through the Center and you may come across the Seattle Armory. Built in 1939, this site once housed the 146th Field Artillery and included a firing range and tanks. Today, the site is nicknamed the �Center of the Center� and contains a selection of local food and drink vendors in its Food and Event Hall. Also, look out for Seattle�s premier arts centers, like the Seattle Repertory Theatre, Cornish Playhouse and the McCaw Hall, home to the Pacific Northwest Ballet and Seattle Opera. If there�s time, music fans may get the chance to pop into a local radio station and the Light in the Attic Records store. Found in the KEXP Gathering Space, this independent record store was built as a dedication to the culture of U.S. independent record stores. Make a stop at the International Fountain, an attraction built for the Century 21 Expo or World�s Fair. Originally built as a fountain dome of iron nozzles within a rocky circle, the water feature fit the year�s theme of the Space Age. Since then, the fountain has gone through several iterations, losing the rocks and iron and becoming a fun play area. With your guide, walk through the Center for your pre-arranged timed entry to the Seattle Space Needle. Built in 1962 as a landmark attraction for the World�s Fair, the Needle aimed to encapsulate the theme of Space Age thinking. Nowadays, it continues to delight guests and dominate the city skyline, offering 360-degree views of Seattle and, if the weather allows, the far-off snowy peaks of Mount Rainier, the Cascades and the Olympic Mountain ranges. Your guide will share with you the attraction�s history and point out Seattle landmarks you may like to visit during your trip.

Hit Chinatown to see where China and Canada collide, then visit the Kensington Market area for graffiti, vintage shops, coffee houses, comic book stores, and everything else decidedly hip.","Experience the sights, sounds, and smells of Toronto's legendary Chinatown

On this Toronto walking tour you'll have the chance to get up close and personal with both of these local favourites, experiencing the rich history, vibrant cultures, and iconic uniqueness both Chinatown and Kensington Market are known for. The streets around Chinatown and Kensington Market are often crowded, but always friendly. With a reputation for local and international delicacies, unique vendors, and specialty shops, there really is nowhere else like this in Toronto. Distinctively different, yet undeniably and inherently similar, these two neighbourhoods sit right next to each other, offering both a wonderful juxtaposition, and interesting compliment to one another � perfect for exploring together on this unique tour of Toronto. In Kensington Market, over a coffee or tea at a local cafe, you�ll learn how the neighbourhood has evolved from a working-class Jewish market into a working-class bohemian market. Several waves of immigrant settlement over the past century have splashed colours, sounds, and flavours from the four corners of the earth throughout Kensington Market, and yet there is not a McDonald's or Starbucks to be seen. Large multinational corporations are decidedly unwelcome, and unlikely to migrate their way in anytime soon. One of the many highlights of this tour is a visit to a local food vendor to awaken your taste buds to Kensington Market�s international flavour. Aside from its aversion to corporations, the neighbourhood is known for its festivals (Pedestrian Sunday is a favourite), vintage shops, cafes, bakeries, hole-in-the-wall bars, and the many, many bare brick walls that have long been covered with graffiti murals (often at the request of the buildings� owners). These murals are nearly all stunning, and have become one of the iconic features of the neighbourhood. Your local guide will be happy to elaborate on any element of the neighbourhood you find particularly interesting on this Kensington Market tour in Toronto � we all love this area a lot! As we said, right next door to Kensington Market is Chinatown, one of Canada's largest Chinese communities, and one of the largest Chinatowns in North America. One of the busiest areas in the city, there�s always something happening, and always tales to tell. On this part of your Toronto tour, your guide will enlighten you with some favourite local stories and intriguing history surrounding Toronto�s Chinatown. Along the way, you�ll also likely get restaurant recommendations, which can really come in handy for after your Toronto Chinatown tour � trust us, there are a lot of places to eat around here. By the time your Toronto tour is over, we can pretty much guarantee that you�ll want to hang around Chinatown and pop back into Kensington Market on your own for a while to pick up some vintage or one-of-a-kind souvenirs and gifts, and to devour a truly delicious meal at any of the dozens of tasty spots nearby.

We reserve the right to change both the route and places visited within the tour. Food inclusions are subject to change, dependent on availability on the day.","All the stores and foodie spots we visit are 100% owned and run by locals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, ensuring that local people benefit from tourism to their city. So any inclusions on the tour and additional purchases you make will directly benefit the local community.
You will pick up some responsible travel tips that will help you to be a greener traveller while you�re in the city.","For shared tours, the maximum group number will be 12 passengers. For private tours, there must be a minimum of 2 passengers.

You can decide for yourself after a taste of it! It�s a truly local spot we love introducing our guests to.� From there, you�ll make your way to St. Lawrence Market - National Geographic once declared it the �Best Food Market in the World� - where you will learn about the origin of Toronto�s official signature food: the peameal bacon sandwich, which is a must-try food in the market.

Each stop also offers the opportunity to interact with vendors, ask questions, and learn even more from the experts!� Foods of your tour can include butter tarts, mustard and pretzel sticks, ginger ale, Montreal-style bagels, cheese curds, pierogis, maple candy, and more!� The final stop on the tour will be a local pub which has been around for decades. This spot not only serves the popular French-Canadian dish known as poutine; they do a variation on it which shows the creativity that comes with being unbeholden to any specific culinary tradition!� By the end of this tour, you will not only have a better understanding of what Canadian food is, but also a little bit about about what it means to be Canadian!",,"For private tours, there must be a minimum of 2 passengers.

For the next four hours, you�ll experience Cairo the way locals do, and see the city from their perspective. We�ll start our Cairo tour at New Opera Square in Zamalek, winding our way through Cairo�s ancient and recent history, emerging, fittingly, at Old Opera Square near Attaba. From the city�s most beautiful bridge spanning the Nile, we�ll head towards Liberation Square, which hosted many events during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, and is a significant landmark in the city�s modern history. In addition to the beautiful 19th and 20th Century architecture featured in downtown Cairo, our walking tour will allow you to check out modern artwork in the form of graffiti. Typically, this graffiti expresses locals� views towards the Revolution and various political parties. In this area, every corner has its own story to tell, with most intersections featuring a statue of an important historical figure. Not to worry - your local guide will help fill in any gaps to give you better context for what you�re seeing. To cap off our local Cairo walking tour, we�ll indulge in a local dish: Koshary, in an authentic local restaurant. Koshary is a mix of rice, pasta, lentils, fried onions, and chili sauce, and is one of our faves.

Ready?!Located approximately 30 km south of modern-day Cairo, Saqqara is a vast, ancient burial ground in Egypt with the world's oldest standing step pyramid. It's the first stop on our day tour from Cairo, and certainly is an impressive way to start the day. Designed by Imhotep for King Djoser (c.2667-2648 BC), the Step Pyramid is the oldest complete stone-hewn building complex known in history, and is surrounded by other small pyramids dating back to the 5th and 6th Dynasties. Although Saqqara was eclipsed as the burial ground of royalty by Giza and the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (near Luxor), it remained an important complex for burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000 years. Next up, we're off to Memphis, which functioned as the ancient capital of Lower Egypt and of the Old Kingdom of Egypt from its foundation until around 2200 BC. The modern towns of Dahshur and Saqqara lie within the administrative borders of historical Memphis. Wander around, explore, and immerse yourself in the atmosphere of some really, really old cities. Careful not to stand in place for too long - you might mummify! Just kidding. Shake off the dust of the past, bid farewell to these decidedly less touristy pyraminds, and conclude your Cairo pyramids tour by heading back to the big, modern city. It'll be a stark contrast to Saqqara and Memphis, but we're pretty sure you can handle it.

The Giza Plateau is a formation of three pyramids, where a father, son, and grandson constructed their afterlife tombs and mapped their journeys to the afterlife. It�s still a bit of a mystery as to how the pyramids were constructed and how long they took to complete, but there�s no question that the pyramids still represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian architectural accomplishments. The whole area, really, continues to hold many secrets yet to be uncovered, making the pyramids one of the most alluring and inviting places in the world. Our job is to help you tick off that bucket list item, and then some, with a half-day tour to the pyramids that�s going to prove to you why everyone reveres this site so much. What sets our Pyramids tour apart from the others is that we beat the tourists and arrive at the Giza Plateau well before the crowds and that ruthless midday sun. We also treat you to a local lunch! Pyramids, Sphinx, and lunch? Oh my! Our day starts by seeing the guardian of the necropolis, the Sphinx (you know, the one with the missing nose!), which stands in front of the second Pyramid of Khepren. We will enter the Giza Plateau from the Sphinx Gate to beat the crowds to the site, and after seeing the Sphinx, we�ll walk to the mysterious great pyramid of King Cheops, where you can marvel at the sheer size of the construction, and try and formulate your own theories as to how it was built. Our private Pyramids tour continues to the second Pyramid of Giza, which is the second largest and the only pyramid that still carries part of its original casing. From there, we�ll continue to the third and the smallest of the Giza Plateau pyramids. And no visit to the Pyramids of Giza would be completed without stopping at the panoramic view point where you get to see the all the pyramids of Giza in the one spot (and take a photo like the ones you see in travel books � free of tourists! Well, almost�) Leaving the amazing pyramids behinds, we�ll head back out to the streets of Cairo and stop by a local restaurant for lunch. We�ll be treating you to Koshary, a dish of rice, pasta, lentils, fried onions, and chili sauce, and a favourite amongst young local Egyptians. After lunch, we�ll drop you back off at one of our starting points, where you can carry on your day (although we�re pretty sure the Pyramids will have already been the highlight of the day!).

We won�t go inside, but you�ll want to note where it is for a return visit later on in your own time, we�re sure!

Nearby, you�ll spot the Sqala tower, with canons dating back to the Portuguese era and a view of the Atlantic Ocean. Walk through alleyways to reach the medina, where you can browse alongside locals going about their day-to-day business, shopping for groceries, clothing and anything and everything else.

From here, well make our way by taxi and on foot to see a few architectural marvels of the city: first we'll stop by the Sacred Heart Cathedral, a grand, former Roman Catholic cathedral, from 1930, designed by Paul Tournon in the neo-Gothic style. Then we'll take a few pictures in the beautiful and very modern Arab League Parc and finally we'll take a short walk to the French Colonial-style Mohammed V Plaza, also known as Pigeon Square.

We�ll then make our way over to the Habous quarter, also known as the new medina, where you can shop for Moroccan goods such as traditional clothing, leather, jewellery and food. The medina was built in the 1916s by the French, so it is no surprise that it features a wonderful mix of French and Moroccan-inspired architecture, complete with numerous things to see and do and taste� like maybe some impossibly delicious marinated spicy olives.

We�ll visit one of the oldest & most famous local bakeries in town called Bennis Pastry House, since 1938 locals have been taking their breads and pastries to be baked (#localsknow tip: all the treats at Bennis are delicious, but we recommend the chicken pastilla, which is heavenly good!) Treat yourself to a selection of traditional Moroccan pastries. Such as gazelle horns, which are pastries filled with a paste of almond and orange water or Fekkas which is a famous twice-baked Moroccan cookie & more.?

We�ll then head to a nearby?local coffee shop to order coffee or Moroccan tea?and scoff your bounty. With our sugar fix done we�ll take a transfer to the grand finale for this tour: Al Aank Observation Deck. A gorgeous promenada by the ocean that offers incredible views of Hassan II Mosque and of the city. Here you can spend some time relaxing or taking amazing photographs.

With its minaret towering up 210 metres, the Hassan II Mosque blends Islamic architecture with Moroccan elements, Moorish influences with urban design. If you�re up on your Moroccan architecture, some of the design elements may seem familiar � see if you can spot the similarities with other Moroccan buildings such as the unfinished Hassan mosque in Rabat and the Koutoubia mosque in Marrakech. As you explore, learn some interesting facts about Islam that are unique to Morocco. For example, while Islam doesn�t permit followers to believe in any god beyond Allah, some locals continue to make sacrifices to Sidi Abderrahmane, who is considered to be a saint by many Moroccans. Locals often ask for his blessing, especially in the Arabic month of Chaabane, before Ramadan, and go to his shrine off the coast of Casablanca for healing from disease, fertility issues and even finding a mate! Next up, it�s time to learn about Casablanca�s Jewish heritage with a trip to the mellah (Jewish quarter) of the old medina. It is here that the city�s Jewish past has been best preserved, and is also where it continues to live today. There are some 5,000 Jews currently living in Casablanca, and the city is home to more than 30 synagogues, plus Jewish monuments, cemeteries and shrines. (And plenty of kosher restaurants as well � be sure to ask your local guide for tips on where to grab a bite to eat after your tour!). Because the mellah was only established less than a century ago, it�s relatively young by Moroccan standards, but it is an important piece of local Jewish history. We�ll then work our way over to a gorgeous museum inside a home, where a private collection of Moroccan artwork awaits. This house is the former home of Abderrahman Slaoui, a Moroccan businessman who loved the arts. As we peruse the artworks, we�ll stop for a refreshing Moroccan mint tea to help perk us up for the short walk to our next stop. From there, we�ll take our private transport over to the imposing Notre Dame de Lourdes Church, with its architecture that�s oh-so-different from what you expect to find in Morocco! The European-inspired church towers over its neighbouring buildings. Finally, we�ll again take a private taxi transfer to the Museum of Moroccan Judaism, which features collections and exhibits covering 2,000 years of Jews in Morocco. You�ll find videos, photographs, paintings, sculptures and historic documents explaining the past and present of local Jewish life. After exploring the museum, your guide will escort you back to Square of Mohammed V, Casablanca via private transfer. Before you go, don�t forget to ask your guide for tips on what else to see and do in Casablanca.",,This private tour is priced for a minimum group size of two travellers.

We kick off this Marrakech medina tour and food experience at the beautiful and legendary Djemaa El-Fna square, home to almost a millennium of trading, bargaining, eating, and mingling. You�ll feel the history, tradition, and culture instantly, and after an initial briefing, we�ll wander off into the small streets branching off from the square. Along the way, we�ll stop at hidden local shops that most tourists won�t find, to taste a few of the numerous different versions of olives, and snack on nuts and other typical Moroccan treats, before heading off towards the poultry/beef market to see how the locals shop and bargain. Sampling all kinds of food in Marrakech is a fascinating insight into the local life and traditions, and with all the different kinds of places your guide will take you, you�ll see many different sides to the part it has to play in Marrakech culture. From there, we�ll head to one of the most popular sections � the spice section! Moroccan cuisine is known for its vibrant spices, and here you�ll learn how the spices are used in traditional cuisine, how Marrakech became such a popular spot for spice trading, and get inspired to recreate Moroccan culinary masterpieces when you get home. The spice market will totally enchant you with its exotic smells and bold colours from the likes of cumin, saffron, ginger, pepper, turmeric�we could go on, but you�d best just travel to Marrakech and see for yourself! We continue our Moroccan food odyssey through the souks, where we�ll discover the many traditional breads, learn how nomadic communities preserved meat for periods of scarcity and wars, perhaps try a cow hoof or sheep�s head, and stop by to try some Ghoulal. We�ll end up in the square where, after seeing all the fresh ingredients of the souks and markets, we�ll enjoy a traditional Moroccan dinner amid the bustling World Heritage listed Djemaa El-Fna at its peak. Surrounded by people, snakes and their charmers, monkeys and their mischief, the atmosphere is hard to beat. We�re pretty sure this will be an experience that�ll stick with you for a very long time.
