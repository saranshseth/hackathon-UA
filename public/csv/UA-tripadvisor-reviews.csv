We arrived for the tour a bit early to get some uncrowded photos of our family in the Zocalo, and met up with Adriana at tour time. After introducing the group of 10 participants, we took a short walk to a local market where we were treated to a delicious breakfast of tamales and a traditional Mexican chocolate drink. There were three in our family, so we ordered one of each variety and got to sample all of them. (Our favorites were the mole and the verde!) We then walked back to the Zocalo, learning some history about the City and its inhabitants along the way. Adriana gave us all a quick lesson on how to use the Mexico City subway, and we were off on a quick ride out to a huge local market. (Pro tip – the subway doors only stay open for 5 seconds at each stop!) The market was amazing, with anything and everything you would ever need for a life in the city. We were able to taste several fantastic foods, including concentrated mole, fresh jimaca with chili powder, and some wonderful Oxacan cheese, to name a few. Adriana also helped us shop for the ingredients to make our own salsa, which was a highlight of the day as we had an entire restaurant to ourselves just outside the main market.

We did a city tour afterward and it felt so boring in comparison. This one was fun, interesting, unique, and full of cool stories. If you're visiting Kensington/Chinatown, you have to do this - without it, you'd miss the deep history and meaning behind what you're seeing. You would miss out on a lot.. Kieran gave us a deeper appreciation for the area - the beautiful art (!!) , the history, and the stories behind the buildings and people.

Kieran was a FANTASTIC guide - friendly, funny, welcoming, and a great speaker & storyteller. He shared so many meaningful stories and fun facts. We loved it! Made the tour so interesting and fun!

One thing to note: the tour says 3 hours, but if your group is small, it might be shorter. That didn’t bother us at all - we care more about quality than the exact length. It still felt full and complete.

The pace was great too. I liked that it wasn’t rushed and had a good balance of walking, listening, and a little resting. I also loved the coffee shop Kieran took us to—it was quirky, fun, and sparked some conversation and laughs… (but I won't give away the details!)

This tour is more for people who enjoy something unique, fun..... especially if you appreciate diverse cultures, local history, and understanding how a neighborhood came to be the way it is. It’s not your average city tour, and that’s what makes it so special and fun.

Overall, a beautiful, memorable experience!",Written 11 May 2025,13 contributions,"M1215YQ

A delightful afternoon in Paris!

Due to airline scheduling issues, we found ourselves with a full day layover in Paris.

Essential tour for a successful trip to Paris

Hi Robert, Thank you for your recent review. We are sorry to learn of your disappointment in the tour you purchased for you time in Paris. We have looked at your complaint and are quite sure that while you may have intended to purchase a wine tour, that in actuality you did purchase the https://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Hidden-Paris-Discover-Medieval-Marais-on-a-Walking-Tour/d479-5944P3 which is inclusive of a local English speaking guide and a croissant. When looking at wine and cheese tours there is nothing listed that coincides with the price range of your ticketing. We do believe this to have been an error perhaps in selecting the tour you intended, and the one that you booked. We do believe that the tour you purchase is what was delivered, and therefore will not be providing a refund to you at this time. We are happy to provide to you a 10% Future Booking Voucher as a gesture of goodwill, and we do hope that you managed to enjoy your time in Paris. With thanks, Michelle

Remy gave us a great tour with 5 stops, each progressively better than the last. My favorite was the Spanish tortilla and also the dessert stop. Great tour with great food, and Remy told us about the history of the area we toured in. Highly recommended!

We flew over on Turkish Airlines, which treated us very well; their customer service, flight crew and Business Lounge (in Istanbul through which which we connected) were exceptional.

The car service we used from airport to hotel and back was provided by Welcome Tours; punctual, reasonably priced and very safe driving.

Our hotel in Athens was the Grande Bretagne Athens, situated in the heart of the city on Constitution Square, diagonally adjacent to the Greek Parliament (notable for its hourly Changing of the Guard. The hotel is an old-world gem with high-ceilinged rooms and efficient and friendly staff. The concierge staff was especially helpful.

During our five-night stay, we benefitted tremendously by having booked three private three-hour tours offered by Context Travel; we've now also used them in Dublin, Istanbul, Paris and Rome and they are simply, hands down, the very best! We toured the Acropolis, Parthenon and Acropolis Museum on our first day of touring; the National Archaeological Museum of Athens on the second; and the Ancient Agora with Plaka Neighborhood on the third. Just outstanding tours led by by totally knowledgeable and super friendly tour guides. Words to the wise: Wear very comfortable shoes and always carry water with you.

Lastly our meals: Starting every day with an expansive breakfast buffet at our hotel's Rooftop Restaurant energized our tours of the city. We enjoyed two delicious dining experiences at this same restaurant looking out at the picture-postcard-perfect lit-up Acropolis. Another evening we dined at Tudor Hall in the Grand Bretagne's adjacent sister hotel, the King George; a very elegant, impeccably served and rather pricey restaurant, but a tad more fancy than appetite-satisfying. Cookoovaya was perhaps a more trendy eatery, a little off the beaten path, but with delicious menu, very ample servings and reasonably priced. On our final night in Athens, we were able to get in (reservations way in advance recommended) to Dionysos Zonar's; outdoor dining with a perfect view of the nearby lit-up Parthenon made for a most memorable evening!

During our entire stay in Athens, we felt appreciated, safe and very welcome.

Dear Ganendra Raj K, Can't Thank you enough for making the time and leaving another review for our Morning Walking Tour with our mighty Babis!!! For our team, it is very important to make our guests feel straight at home, especially the firsttimers, from the very moment they start their exploration of the city. We make sure you have tons of fun on our tour, but also we provide ideas of what you can experience while in Athens independently the following days, as an Athenian, not just the touristic highlight and a get a taste of our Philoxenia. So we are thrilled to read that you enjoyed the experience with Urban Adventures and we can only wish to see you again sometime soon :) From Babis and Urban Adventures Safe Travels and Sunny Regards

A very long tour I admit, but we had so much fun with Peter - world's best guide - the time flew by.
I expected we would visit a couple of coffee cafes and, in accordance with their coffee culture, spend an hour or two at each with a food stop somewhere in between. We did partake of a traditional coffee cafe, but then we did so very much more.

A great way to spend a few hours hearing about the history of the market and sampling the best the market has to offer. Some very generous samples were included from a number of vendors in the market, plus a coffee, gelato and donut.

Tour guide Tristian was extremely knowledgeable about the market and had some great recommendations for things to do and see around Melbourne. Definitely recommend for locals or tourists.

As a local, it was hard to be impressed by a tour of the Queen Victoria Market, but I did learn a few new things, which was a pleasant surprise.

However, the tour's framing felt misleading. While the market itself is multicultural, the tour was not.

The guide's approach to food could be seen a culturally insensitive. The guide showed little knowledge or appreciation for certain cuisines, describing them with a hint of disdain that could easily offend. This was highlighted by her judgmental tone when she discussed the market's 'unhygienic' past, a comment that seemed to ignore the reality of how many traditional wet markets operate worldwide.
On the converse the guide celebrated European food with great enthusiasm.

In the end, the tour felt whitewashed and failed to genuinely celebrate the market's diversity.
Slightly disappointed in Intrepid and perhaps some unconcious bias training is in order.

Hello Troy, We appreciate your feedback. We rely on our travellers’ feedback as it’s a firsthand insight into what is happening on our trips. This allows us to review our trips and make improvements, as well as recognise the positive, like the great job your guides did. Thank you for bringing this to our attention about some of the trams that we take our travellers are necessarily accessible for all travellers along with only receiving a beer instead of a paddled, it is through feedback like this that we are able to review and make any changes.

If you're looking for something a bit different and authentic, this is the perfect tour. Actually it doesn't even feel like a traditional tour - it's just a super fun night out that I would highly recommend whether you're a Melbourne local or visitor.",Written 28 October 2019,"Kalon H

What a fantastic experience with our tour guide Flo, who is really passionate and informative. You could tell he loved what he was doing and he had strong personal connections with all the bar staff. Thanks so much Flo.

Hi Mackenzie, Thank you for your recent review. We are sorry to know that you did not have the experience as we always aim to deliver. We will be discussing your review with Mohammed in order to develop him in the ways that he is lacking- we apologize if you ever felt your guide to be condescending- this should never happen. The restaurant and outcome that your guide provided to you will also be reviewed. While we understand that Morocco is very much a tipping culture, the amounts should always be received with thanks. We appreciate the time you have taken to let us know about your experience, Mackenzie, and should you think to come along with us again we hope that you would consider a 15% Future Booking Voucher for the negative experience. We are happy to learn that you did have some positives from your tour time, and we hope that you enjoyed your time in Morocco. Stay well.

We met our friendly guide Brahim and the British couple that were also on the tour. Brahim explained the tour for us and we began walking around the Medina, starting in the Jewish quarter where we got to taste tea and freshly baked doughnuts, not like any we have tasted before. Thin crust and soft in the middle. Next stop was to taste different olives, spiced, green and black. Even those on the tour who didn't like olives found some of these very good. Now our guide stopped by a sweet booth where he bought some dessert for us to have after the main dinner. The main dinner was a delicious slow cooked meat in a restaurant that was already closed, since they close when everything is sold out. Our guide had reserved this for us. The last food we had was a homemade soup served at a stall in the middle of the square by the sons of the woman who cooked it earlier. Before we said goodbye, we had a spiced hot drink similar to Gluck wine or a Christmas drink. Brahim told us a lot about the culture and cuisine in Morocco. We highly recommend Brahim and this tour.

Just get lost
It is always pleasant to stroll through the Souk d emarrakesh and feel the energy of the comora sellers and above all their mysticism.
Going to Marrakesh is going to the medina and getting lost in it, getting involved. Go to each of the production zones of each mastery and learn and get out of it or not with something, even if it is knowledge.

Hi Martin , I hope that you are well and thank you for your feedback. Did the guide have an Urban Adventures badge ? We don't have any guides named Mohamed , they are a lot of guides in front of café France that lie and tell people that they work for the company that the clients say so you can you can tag a long with them. We are sorry for the hassle caused by this , please reach out to us if you are in Marrakech again so we can redo the tour for you properly. Cheers, Marrakech UA

However, our guide Yogi gave us an in-depth explanation of each site we visited, gave us time to explore, and was able to answer all of our questions regarding the temples, Hinduism, and Nepal’s spiritual traditions. It was nice to have the backstory along with the beauty of Kathmandu’s religious sites. 10/10 recommend this tour and Yogi especially!!!

Hi Matthew - thanks so much for sharing your review, we really appreciate your recommendation and are sorry to hear the heat and busyness of the Grand Palace was a bit too much. In our peak tourist season it really does get packed with visitors. I'm also sorry to hear that it felt a bit rushed, it's really helpful for us to have this kind of feedback so we can work with our team to develop their skills and help them grow as guides. We aim to provide a 5 Star experience for all our customers so it's really helpful to know if we're not quite making it. Happy travels wherever they take you next :)

I really enjoyed the tour. My guide Pam is very nice, knowledgeable and an excellent story-teller. We had a unique opportunity to visit a small local farm producing coconut sugar. It was very interesting to see all stages of the process! The Floating market was much fun too. We were going by boat around stalls with souvenirs, enjoyed picturesque view and nature. I recommend this tour to everyone who is looking for one-day adventure

From start to finish, everything ran smoothly, and all provisions were perfectly taken care of — not a single detail was overlooked.

Our guide, Thanh, was exceptional — friendly, knowledgeable, and full of fascinating insights about the region. His storytelling made the history and culture of the Delta come alive. The drive to My Tho took around 2.5 hours, and from there, our private boat ride down the Mekong River was the perfect way to begin the adventure.

We visited a local fish farm and saw firsthand how the local industries thrive here. Sampling tropical fruits on a lush island was a refreshing treat, and the stop at the coconut candy factory was both educational and delicious! Thanh explained the entire candy-making process, and of course, we got to try some for ourselves.

One of the highlights was traveling by Xe Loi through local villages, which gave us a genuine glimpse into daily life. The bee farm visit was sweet (pun intended!), and the rowing boat ride through the narrow canals was peaceful and beautiful — a moment of true tranquility.

Lunch at Vuon Dau was a culinary delight. Thanh helped us navigate the menu and introduced us to some unforgettable local dishes. It was the perfect ending to a truly immersive experience.

I highly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to see the real Vietnam beyond the city. It was informative, relaxing, and incredibly fun. Thank you, Thanh, for making it such a memorable day!",Written 31 July 2025,"Curious60043113754

Must-do tour to see all the best sites of Istanbul with a great guide
Fabulous day with Berivan in Istanbul! She was so knowledgeable and passionate about her city that it was a joy to learn from her. Loved seeing key sites like Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. She spent extra time with us to ensure we saw the Grand Bazar and Spice Bazar, along with a memorable ice cream experience and coffee fortune telling. Highly recommend this experience for an intro to Istanbul.

Alexandria
Stop: 10 hours
Are you ready for an awe-inspiring day? Then let's get to it! Alexandria is one of the world's most impressive historical cities, and certainly a must-see in Egypt, so if you're thinking about doing this day tour from Cairo...what are you waiting for?! It'll take us about a three hour drive from Cairo before our day tour of Alexandria will truly begin, and where better to kick it off than the Catacombs of Kom Ash-Suqqafa. One of the world's largest Roman burial sites, the Catacombs are one of Alexandria's most popular attractions. Watch your head as you descend into a network of underground passages, tombs, and antechambers via aspiral staircase over a three-level labyrinth (seriously cool, isn't it?!). Dozens of chambers with sculpted pillars and statues await your curiosity, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where relatives of the deceased traditionally hosted memorial meals. Our next stop is the National Museum, home to Greek and Roman era masterpiece ruins discovered under the water on the shores of Alexandria. Super impressive old stuff right here! We will enjoy an Egyptian local lunch , Alexandria is famous for its fresh sea food (vegetarian and other dietaries will be accommodated). After lunch we will head to the former site of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the seven ancient wonders of the world. Although the lighthouse is no longer standing, atop its ruins lie the Citadel of Qaitbay, a defensive fortress built in the 15th century. Designed as a defence along the Mediterranean coastline, the Citadel offers extensive views, fresh Mediterranean air, and a supreme sense of historical significance. Our final stop in Alexandria day tour will be the Alexandria Library. Nerd time! Inspired by the original great library of Alexandria, the modern library was built to hold over eight million books. Built between 1995 and 2002, it covers 11 cascading levels and although it has not yet reached its capacity, it's an impressive homage to the ancient splendour of Alexandria. Pick your jaws up off the ground and explore! As one of Egypt’s most historically significant cities, Alexandria really is a must-see for history and culture buffs. We have no doubt it will leave you enriched, impressed, and perhaps a little awe-struck. Following recent safety incidents we recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest information on travelling in Egypt before your departure and ensure that your travel insurance covers you for all areas of your itinerary.

I would like to extend my compliments to Mohamed, our tour guide, and Amro, our driver, for the days tour.

I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and nurturing care towards my brother & I. 

This is our first time in Egypt from Australia and I am in awe towards Mohameds knowledge and passion towards tourism and the Egyptian history. We received an exquisite and a beautifully unique experience from Mohamed in the last 2 days. 

A tour guide can definitely make or break your experience and Mohamed made our experience a delightful one. 

Our comfort and experience was his priority and we were heart warmed by his genuine efforts.  I have seen many people from all walks of life in my travel experiences to Bali, Australia, France, America, Mexico, Lebanon, Syria and UAE, together with my profession as a Fraud and Intelligence investigator, and when I come across a genuine person like Mohamed who genuinly loves their job and treats foreigners with kindness, respect and care, they truly deserve a spotlight. I have never received such care for his customers & tourism from any tour guide like Mohamed. Tourism is not just a job for Mohamed, it is a passion and we witnessed his divine knowledge and expertise.  The tour was incredible!!

We highly recommend using urban adventures. Mohammad is a great asset. Having Mohamed as your guide makes the experience. 

We LOVE Egypt ???? and we can't wait to come back!

Perfect tour for anyone needing the highlights covered in 1 day. I would recommend this tour and would do it again.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and we're truly sorry to hear how disappointed you were with your tour in Cairo. We understand how frustrating it must have been to wait for a service that didn’t arrive, especially with limited time in the city and travel plans already in place. This is certainly not the experience we aim to provide, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience and stress this caused. Unfortunately, we've been unable to locate your booking or contact information based on the details in your review. If you're open to it, we’d really appreciate the opportunity to look into this further and understand what went wrong. You're welcome to reach out to us directly at customercare@intrepidtravel.com with your booking details, and our team will do our best to follow up promptly. Thank you again for your feedback, we genuinely value it, and we’re sorry that we let you down on this occasion.

Overall, the experience is certainly very authentic and gives you a great opportunity to wander around the city with a great guide.

Was a personal tour since I was the only one booked. I am so grateful they did not cancel. The tour was informative about the history and interesting. It also included a wonderful lunch. Bogdan was so nice, I highly recommend this tour. The max is 8, even with a group it is a great way to get to know Bucharest.

From the moment the tour started, Alex set the tone with his warm, friendly energy and genuine enthusiasm for both Romanian cuisine and culture. He was not only incredibly knowledgeable and informative, but also knew exactly how to engage the group, encouraging conversation and making everyone feel at ease. What could have been a simple food tasting turned into a fun, social experience, thanks to his thoughtful approach and storytelling.

Alex did a wonderful job weaving in historical and cultural context with each stop — not just talking about the dishes themselves, but also about how they fit into Romania’s broader culinary traditions and social history. He struck the perfect balance between sharing information and letting the group enjoy the moment. His passion for the city and its food came through clearly and made the whole experience feel authentic and memorable.

As for the food — it was abundant, varied, and absolutely delicious. Each stop offered something different, from traditional Romanian staples to lesser-known local specialties. We never felt rushed, and we definitely didn’t leave hungry! The pacing was just right, with plenty of time to enjoy each bite and chat with the others on the tour.

I have never had a tour guide more invested in my time and ensuring I had the best experience ever.

10/10 and would definitely do again!

The tour ends on a small fishing/river boat if you have experienced and dined on one of the larger boats with the buffets and entertainment this is the pleasant opposite.

Nabil was an amazing guide and really went above and beyond to personalize our tour! He was really knowledgeable about everything and so passionate about seafood and Boston’s history. The food was also so delicious and better than anything we could have found by ourselves. Thanks again Nabil!

Walking through the seaport area with Tim explaining the history of the fishing industry, the wharf, & south Boston was a great way to explore the area. It was a warm day so Tim prioritizing finding us a (mostly) shady route was much appreciated.
