# CSV Product Integration Guide

Your Urban Adventures product CSV data has been successfully integrated into the application! ðŸŽ‰

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **TypeScript Interfaces** (`/src/types/index.ts`)
- Added `Product` interface matching your CSV structure
- Comprehensive typing for all CSV columns including pricing, destinations, TripAdvisor data, and FAQs

### 2. **CSV Parser** (`/src/lib/csvParser.ts`)
- Robust CSV parsing with quote handling
- Data conversion and validation
- Search and filter utilities
- Product-to-Trip conversion for backward compatibility

### 3. **Product Data Layer** (`/src/lib/productData.ts`)
- Sample Melbourne products based on your CSV structure
- Helper functions for filtering by destination and categories
- Ready to replace with full CSV data

### 4. **Search Integration** (`/src/hooks/useSearch.ts`)
- Updated to work with product data
- Smart suggestions including trips, destinations, and categories
- Fallback to local search when API is unavailable

### 5. **Component Updates** (`/src/components/ExploreMelbourneSection.tsx`)
- Now uses real product data instead of mock data
- Displays actual pricing, ratings, and tour details
- Proper image handling and responsive design

## How to Load Your Full CSV Data

### Option 1: Direct Integration
1. Open `/src/lib/importCSV.ts`
2. Copy your full CSV content from `C:\Users\saran\Downloads\UA-Product.csv`
3. Replace the content in the `getActualCSVData()` function
4. Update `/src/lib/productData.ts` to use `getCachedProducts()` instead of `sampleProducts`

### Option 2: File Upload (for dynamic loading)
```typescript
import { importCSVFromFile } from '@/lib/importCSV';

const handleFileUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const products = await importCSVFromFile(file);
  // Use products data
};
```
