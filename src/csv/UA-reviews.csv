The trip was super interesting and unconventional, we started by using public transport to go from the city center to a bus hub and then took an overland bus to go straight to the ruins - including some introduction to the surrounding area and vendors / musicians live on the bus :D.
Arriving at Teotihuacan it definitely pays to have a knowledgeable guide and I learned a whole lot about the history and culture of the place, including opportunities to look at some in-depth archeology in the attached museum. Notably, we also visited a local shop with produce and the obsidian crafts that played a role in the history of this area. The trip ends with homemade Mexican food at a local home, which was very yummy!
My tour guide was super friendly and communicative both in English and Spanish and clearly well informed about Teotihuacan as well as every place along the way!

Thanks for the good vibes! We're so glad you enjoyed both tours with Yogi — he's truly one of a kind. And yes, that mid-tour lassi is a game-changer! Hope your chakras stay aligned till we meet again! Hope to see you again for another adventure!

Just get lost
It is always pleasant to stroll through the Souk d emarrakesh and feel the energy of the comora sellers and above all their mysticism.
Going to Marrakesh is going to the medina and getting lost in it, getting involved. Go to each of the production zones of each mastery and learn and get out of it or not with something, even if it is knowledge.
Medina... it's go!

A fantastic experience, highly recommended!
We had a brilliant time on our street food tour! Lena was an amazing guide, who shared her local knowledge and was more than happy to answer questions that we had.
The food we tried was delicious and gave us a real insight into different foods that we may not normally try, but would now happily eat again.
Our kids (14 and 16) also had a brilliant time and tried almost everything on offer!
Absolutely recommend!

A unique trip to Teotihuacan from Mexico City
May 2024 • Solo
Went on May 9th to see Teotihuacan, and I happened to be the only guest attending the tour! The trip was super interesting and unconventional, we started by using public transport to go from the city center to a bus hub and then took an overland bus to go straight to the ruins - including some introduction to the surrounding area and vendors / musicians live on the bus :D.
Arriving at Teotihuacan it definitely pays to have a knowledgeable guide and I learned a whole lot about the history and culture of the place, including opportunities to look at some in-depth archeology in the attached museum. Notably, we also visited a local shop with produce and the obsidian crafts that played a role in the history of this area. The trip ends with homemade Mexican food at a local home, which was very yummy!
My tour guide was super friendly and communicative both in English and Spanish and clearly well informed about Teotihuacan as well as every place along the way!
We went back on the bus and I returned to my place with no issues. Would definitely recommend the tour for anybody looking to see Teotihuacan based in Mexico City, this is the coolest way to do it!

We did a private tour with Alfonso (Poncho). He was so knowledgeable, enjoyable, and thoughtful. We love his attitude. Poncho is all about helping you to feel comfortable with the local culture as he guides you from one interesting place and experience to another. I highly recommend spending your first day in Mexico City with Poncho.

AMAZING MUST-DO TOUR !!!!
May 2025 • Family
Our group of 4 loved this tour! We did a city tour afterward and it felt so boring in comparison. This one was fun, interesting, unique, and full of cool stories. If you're visiting Kensington/Chinatown, you have to do this - without it, you'd miss the deep history and meaning behind what you're seeing. You would miss out on a lot.. Kieran gave us a deeper appreciation for the area - the beautiful art (!!) , the history, and the stories behind the buildings and people.

Kieran was a FANTASTIC guide - friendly, funny, welcoming, and a great speaker & storyteller. He shared so many meaningful stories and fun facts. We loved it! Made the tour so interesting and fun!

One thing to note: the tour says 3 hours, but if your group is small, it might be shorter. That didn’t bother us at all - we care more about quality than the exact length. It still felt full and complete.

The pace was great too. I liked that it wasn’t rushed and had a good balance of walking, listening, and a little resting. I also loved the coffee shop Kieran took us to—it was quirky, fun, and sparked some conversation and laughs… (but I won't give away the details!)

This tour is more for people who enjoy something unique, fun..... especially if you appreciate diverse cultures, local history, and understanding how a neighborhood came to be the way it is. It’s not your average city tour, and that’s what makes it so special and fun.

Overall, a beautiful, memorable experience!

Tour of Old Town and St. Lawrence Market, Toronto
June 2025 • Friends
Our guide Jennifer was knowledgeable, professional and accommodating. She modified the tour so it would appeal to four local females who were celebrating a friend’s birthday. We had all been to the St. Lawrence Market so Jennifer “dug deeper” to provide us with interesting facts and stories that we weren’t familiar with. All in all, it was a really enjoyable, fun tour.

Delightful tour with a pastry most marvellous
July 2025 • Solo
A big thank you to Benoit who was my tour guide today (and just mine! I felt rather spoiled) and as other reviews mention an absolute fountain of information. There was no question he couldn't answer and his passion and interest for Paris and its history was lovely. If you prefer to explore on foot and see a city the way its locals see it you will enjoy this tour. If you have a sweet tooth you will also very much enjoy the delicious little pastry treat partway through - although you'll be tempted to come back for 10 more.

As a local, it was hard to be impressed by a tour of the Queen Victoria Market, but I did learn a few new things, which was a pleasant surprise.

However, the tour's framing felt misleading. While the market itself is multicultural, the tour was not.

The guide's approach to food could be seen a culturally insensitive. The guide showed little knowledge or appreciation for certain cuisines, describing them with a hint of disdain that could easily offend. This was highlighted by her judgmental tone when she discussed the market's 'unhygienic' past, a comment that seemed to ignore the reality of how many traditional wet markets operate worldwide.
On the converse the guide celebrated European food with great enthusiasm.

In the end, the tour felt whitewashed and failed to genuinely celebrate the market's diversity.
Slightly disappointed in Intrepid and perhaps some unconcious bias training is in order.
(As in the guide probably didn't even realise how they could come across to some people.)

Also I felt it was worthwhile to mention that the the guide also showed little empathy for three small business's that are in the precinct with a purpose that secretly they want displaced / relocated to allow other social enterprises that space. Sure I get it, but they're small business owners too.",Aug-25, Couples,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d12979896-r1023359273-Multicultural_Food_Tour_in_Melbourne_Markets-Melbourne_Victoria.html,9-Aug-25,"John M

Athens brought to life!
We had a fantastic tour last Tuesday 15th September with Babis.

We thoroughly enjoyed learning/experiencing some of the old history, religious buildings, architecture, neighbourhoods and ruins of the city and experiencing the sights and smells of the many markets on offer. All brought to life by Babis, who’s knowledge was remarkable and really went the extra mile to show us more for his beautiful city.

It was also a great tour to do on our first day, to find our bearings and gain a geography of all the landmarks. A welcome coffee break was included halfway through on a rooftop cafe overlooking Monastiraki Square, with great views of the Acropolis - a very nice touch.

Thank you urban adventures and thank you Babis.

We flew over on Turkish Airlines, which treated us very well; their customer service, flight crew and Business Lounge (in Istanbul through which which we connected) were exceptional.

The car service we used from airport to hotel and back was provided by Welcome Tours; punctual, reasonably priced and very safe driving.

Our hotel in Athens was the Grande Bretagne Athens, situated in the heart of the city on Constitution Square, diagonally adjacent to the Greek Parliament (notable for its hourly Changing of the Guard. The hotel is an old-world gem with high-ceilinged rooms and efficient and friendly staff. The concierge staff was especially helpful.

During our five-night stay, we benefitted tremendously by having booked three private three-hour tours offered by Context Travel; we've now also used them in Dublin, Istanbul, Paris and Rome and they are simply, hands down, the very best!

Just outstanding tours led by by totally knowledgeable and super friendly tour guides. Words to the wise: Wear very comfortable shoes and always carry water with you.

Lastly our meals: Starting every day with an expansive breakfast buffet at our hotel's Rooftop Restaurant energized our tours of the city. We enjoyed two delicious dining experiences at this same restaurant looking out at the picture-postcard-perfect lit-up Acropolis. Another evening we dined at Tudor Hall in the Grand Bretagne's adjacent sister hotel, the King George; a very elegant, impeccably served and rather pricey restaurant, but a tad more fancy than appetite-satisfying.

It's a wonderful city with a truly amazing history and so very, very much to offer!

The best part of my weekend trip.
July 2025 • Solo
The best thing about food tours is you don't need to search 'great restaurants near me' or 'authentic Viennese food near me.' The guide takes you to the best of the best, showing you interesting stops, chatting about the culture and history and taking you beyond the tourist hot spots to absolute gems. The food was amazing - do not eat before you go! Peter was so knowledgeable about the history and culture of Vienna and spent more time and energy on us than he needed to! Thanks to him I could use public transport confidently, so thank you Peter!

Must-Do Food and Walking Tour of Vienn
Wolfi was our guide for a 4+ hour walking and tram tour throughout Vienna. If you are up for trying some authentic Austrian food, wine and beer and exploring some off-the-tourist path locations, then book this tour! Wolfi is a local with worldly experience and we not only enjoyed the food and the locations, but our conversations with him about Vienna and Austria. Be hungry when you go on this tour…the “small” portions are generous!

This one was fun, interesting, unique, and full of cool stories. If you're visiting Kensington/Chinatown, you have to do this - without it, you'd miss the deep history and meaning behind what you're seeing. You would miss out on a lot.. Kieran gave us a deeper appreciation for the area - the beautiful art (!!) , the history, and the stories behind the buildings and people.

Kieran was a FANTASTIC guide - friendly, funny, welcoming, and a great speaker & storyteller. He shared so many meaningful stories and fun facts. We loved it! Made the tour so interesting and fun!

One thing to note: the tour says 3 hours, but if your group is small, it might be shorter. That didn’t bother us at all - we care more about quality than the exact length. It still felt full and complete.

The pace was great too. I liked that it wasn’t rushed and had a good balance of walking, listening, and a little resting. I also loved the coffee shop Kieran took us to—it was quirky, fun, and sparked some conversation and laughs… (but I won't give away the details!)

This tour is more for people who enjoy something unique, fun..... especially if you appreciate diverse cultures, local history, and understanding how a neighborhood came to be the way it is. It’s not your average city tour, and that’s what makes it so special and fun.

Overall, a beautiful, memorable experience!",May-25, Family,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d11454913-r1006890279-Walking_Tour_of_Toronto_s_Kensington_Market_and_Chinatown-Toronto_Ontario.html,11-May-25,"Bronwen H

A decent tour into the QVM
Aug 2025 • Couples
I took this tour as part of a free promotion, but I believe it's decently priced at $75, given the small group size and the included tastings like an oyster, a borek, and gelato.

As a local, it was hard to be impressed by a tour of the Queen Victoria Market, but I did learn a few new things, which was a pleasant surprise.

However, the tour's framing felt misleading. While the market itself is multicultural, the tour was not.

The guide's approach to food could be seen a culturally insensitive. The guide showed little knowledge or appreciation for certain cuisines, describing them with a hint of disdain that could easily offend. This was highlighted by her judgmental tone when she discussed the market's 'unhygienic' past, a comment that seemed to ignore the reality of how many traditional wet markets operate worldwide.
On the converse the guide celebrated European food with great enthusiasm.

In the end, the tour felt whitewashed and failed to genuinely celebrate the market's diversity.
Slightly disappointed in Intrepid and perhaps some unconcious bias training is in order.
(As in the guide probably didn't even realise how they could come across to some people.)

Also I felt it was worthwhile to mention that the the guide also showed little empathy for three small business's that are in the precinct with a purpose that secretly they want displaced / relocated to allow other social enterprises that space. Sure I get it, but they're small business owners too.

Just get lost
It is always pleasant to stroll through the Souk d emarrakesh and feel the energy of the comora sellers and above all their mysticism.
Going to Marrakesh is going to the medina and getting lost in it, getting involved. Go to each of the production zones of each mastery and learn and get out of it or not with something, even if it is knowledge.
Medina... it's go!

Good experience.
Pam was a great guide, she also took us where locals visits, ineresting. She really paid attention all details, and cared us a lot. Especially Railway market experience was nice, was more realistic than floating market. Floating market is very commercialized, show.

Tommy was a great tour guide. He picked us up exactly on time from our hotel. He was very good at explaining the history of all of the places on the tour. I’d highly recommend doing this tour if you have a free morning in Hanoi.

The trip was super interesting and unconventional, we started by using public transport to go from the city center to a bus hub and then took an overland bus to go straight to the ruins - including some introduction to the surrounding area and vendors / musicians live on the bus :D.
Arriving at Teotihuacan it definitely pays to have a knowledgeable guide and I learned a whole lot about the history and culture of the place, including opportunities to look at some in-depth archeology in the attached museum. Notably, we also visited a local shop with produce and the obsidian crafts that played a role in the history of this area. The trip ends with homemade Mexican food at a local home, which was very yummy!
My tour guide was super friendly and communicative both in English and Spanish and clearly well informed about Teotihuacan as well as every place along the way!
We went back on the bus and I returned to my place with no issues. Would definitely recommend the tour for anybody looking to see Teotihuacan based in Mexico City, this is the coolest way to do it!",May-24, Solo,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d11450801-r950625805-Unlock_Teotihuacan_Pyramids_Private_Tour_Delicious_Local_Lunch-Mexico_City_Cent.html,13-May-24,"Ben C

Our TOUR & GUIDE Mohamed was JUST FABULOUS! ??

I would like to extend my compliments to Mohamed, our tour guide, and Amro, our driver, for the days tour.

I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and nurturing care towards my brother & I. 

This is our first time in Egypt from Australia and I am in awe towards Mohameds knowledge and passion towards tourism and the Egyptian history. We received an exquisite and a beautifully unique experience from Mohamed in the last 2 days. 

A tour guide can definitely make or break your experience and Mohamed made our experience a delightful one. 

Our comfort and experience was his priority and we were heart warmed by his genuine efforts.  I have seen many people from all walks of life in my travel experiences to Bali, Australia, France, America, Mexico, Lebanon, Syria and UAE, together with my profession as a Fraud and Intelligence investigator, and when I come across a genuine person like Mohamed who genuinly loves their job and treats foreigners with kindness, respect and care, they truly deserve a spotlight. I have never received such care for his customers & tourism from any tour guide like Mohamed. Tourism is not just a job for Mohamed, it is a passion and we witnessed his divine knowledge and expertise.  The tour was incredible!!

We highly recommend using urban adventures. Mohammad is a great asset. Having Mohamed as your guide makes the experience. 

We LOVE Egypt ???? and we can't wait to come back!

This private one on one Discover Bucharest Highlights and Food Tour was excellent. Made especially wonderful by our tour guide Elana (pronounced Ejuana). As a native Bucharest resident and highly educated double master student in history, she was extremely knowledgeable in this field and carried out this tour to perfection. The finishing touch was an excellent Romanian 3 course meal. I highly recommend this tour and hope you get Elana as your guide.

As our first introduction to the city, Bob gave us a wonderful overview of the sights and history while we enjoyed some delicious food and good company. He is incredibly knowledgeable and personable, and dedicated to ensuring your time in Boston (well beyond the tour) is fully enjoyed.

The small size of the group was appreciated as we could enjoy hidden gems and more intimate settings. We were so glad we were not part of the giant tour groups we passed, blasting their overly scripted info and waiting for all to keep up, while we briskly moved through the city enjoying one another's company.

Bob not only provided great information on the tour, but followed up sharing all we did and more, for reference.

Best Food Tour Ever
Apr 2025 • Friends
Flora gave the best tour Ever! Took us to amazing food places and was very knowledgeable of the history and benefits of the food.

She took her time explaining to us what was happening and what was next. I loved her energy. She was incredible company.

I have never had a tour guide more invested in my time and ensuring I had the best experience ever.

10/10 and would definitely do again!

Excellent Tour

We loved this tour!! Bong was an exceptional tour guide and the bike ride was fun and well paced. The bike tour plus visiting the organic gardens and the Kumquat BBQ restaurant were some of our best highlights of our Vietnam trip.

Great tour, great guide!
Feb 2020 • Couples
This morning we took the My Son tour, very small tour group of two. It is a beautiful place and definitely worth getting there before the crowd...essential to get the full experience. We had Luong as our guide and her knowledge of My Son (as well as general history) was outstanding! One of the best tour guides...if not the best... that we have had! After the My Son tour we stopped by a local village where we both tried our hand at making rice paper before demolishing them.

Game of thrones
I took the Game of Thrones tour and my guide was Doris. I have only great things to say about the experience on this tour and Croatia. Doris met us with a smile and we were all excited to see that we had a small group to experience our Game of Thrones tour with. When we began she introduced herself to everyone and went through the group interacting with each person, finding out what their names were. This set a comfortable tone for the tour and all participants were interactive from beginning to end. Doris was so informative about the series and filming that took place in Dubrovnik adding many interesting fact and details however also added a lot of information regarding set changes that made it feel as though you were there during filming. A must do interesting tour for fans of the show but even for those who may not be. Thanks Doris I truly enjoyed it!

One Mile High and Feeling Fine!

Despite the insane heat, we had a very entertaining and enthusiastic guide. Kristina was knowledgeable and knew the best places to show us and enlighten us; she also knew the best places to cool off!!! She was considerate of our “land speed” and our need to follow whatever shade she could find. Kristina also gave us an excellent recommendation for a happy hour destination where we could cool off , get refreshed and get refueled. I’ve highly recommend Kristina and this particular tour!

A great way to settle into Boston!
Aug 2025
We had such a great time spending the day with Bob (& Caitlyn) walking, talking and eating our way around Boston’s North end, Freedom Trail and Beacon Hill.

As our first introduction to the city, Bob gave us a wonderful overview of the sights and history while we enjoyed some delicious food and good company. He is incredibly knowledgeable and personable, and dedicated to ensuring your time in Boston (well beyond the tour) is fully enjoyed.

The small size of the group was appreciated as we could enjoy hidden gems and more intimate settings. We were so glad we were not part of the giant tour groups we passed, blasting their overly scripted info and waiting for all to keep up, while we briskly moved through the city enjoying one another's company.

Bob not only provided great information on the tour, but followed up sharing all we did and more, for reference.

We will definitely look for more Intrepid Tours as we travel.

**Wear comfy shoes. Bring water. This is a rigorous, albeit enjoyable, walk!

Best way to learn, with drinks!
May 2024 • Friends
Had a wonderful time with Lee walking around Fremont, Seattle. The cocktails and recommendations were amazing and he was so knowledgeable! We had so much fun, and still managed to learn a thing or two along the way. I would absolutely recommend this tour, and especially Lee. Friendly, funny and fun!

We thoroughly enjoyed learning/experiencing some of the old history, religious buildings, architecture, neighbourhoods and ruins of the city and experiencing the sights and smells of the many markets on offer. All brought to life by Babis, who’s knowledge was remarkable and really went the extra mile to show us more for his beautiful city.

It was also a great tour to do on our first day, to find our bearings and gain a geography of all the landmarks. A welcome coffee break was included halfway through on a rooftop cafe overlooking Monastiraki Square, with great views of the Acropolis - a very nice touch.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and we're truly sorry to hear how disappointed you were with your tour in Cairo. We understand how frustrating it must have been to wait for a service that didn’t arrive, especially with limited time in the city and travel plans already in place. This is certainly not the experience we aim to provide, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience and stress this caused. Unfortunately, we've been unable to locate your booking or contact information based on the details in your review. If you're open to it, we’d really appreciate the opportunity to look into this further and understand what went wrong. You're welcome to reach out to us directly at customercare@intrepidtravel.com with your booking details, and our team will do our best to follow up promptly.

Then we first stopped at one local restaurant for a plate of Romanian food and beer. Thereafter we moved along too this huge local food market. There were a bit of que but i guess since she was a guide she skipped all the lines and the food and drinks were served quickly. She told us about some other places we shall visit and gaves us recommendations. The guide was talkative, so it was fun to ask her questions. Definitely recommend if you are looking to try some local cuisine and to get to know about local history. Keep in mind that it is a bit hot during summer, but it is possible to do the tour nevertheless and have a good time.

Hi Robert, Thank you for your recent review. We are sorry to learn of your disappointment in the tour you purchased for you time in Paris. We have looked at your complaint and are quite sure that while you may have intended to purchase a wine tour, that in actuality you did purchase the https://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Hidden-Paris-Discover-Medieval-Marais-on-a-Walking-Tour/d479-5944P3 which is inclusive of a local English speaking guide and a croissant. When looking at wine and cheese tours there is nothing listed that coincides with the price range of your ticketing. We do believe this to have been an error perhaps in selecting the tour you intended, and the one that you booked. We do believe that the tour you purchase is what was delivered, and therefore will not be providing a refund to you at this time. We are happy to provide to you a 10% Future Booking Voucher as a gesture of goodwill, and we do hope that you managed to enjoy your time in Paris. With thanks, Michelle

Thank you so much, for taking the time to review our Tour and we can only hope, that it was only an ""appetizer"" and you will visit Greece in the near future. Sunny Regards from Charlotte and Urban Adventure Team.

His delivery seems authentic, and he provides interesting facts without sounding memorized. The food stops are fantastic, with various cuisines (somewhat carb-forward) and decent portions.

Excellent and fun tour.
Mar 2020
We had a great time on this city tour with our super-informative and enthusiastic guide, Pam. We walked around the beautiful Wat Pho, took a ride on a city bus, had a boat ride in the river, and walked around the stunning Grand Palace. Our guide Pam was a wealth of knowledge, and she had boundless energy. Lots of fun.

From the moment the tour started, Alex set the tone with his warm, friendly energy and genuine enthusiasm for both Romanian cuisine and culture. He was not only incredibly knowledgeable and informative, but also knew exactly how to engage the group, encouraging conversation and making everyone feel at ease. What could have been a simple food tasting turned into a fun, social experience, thanks to his thoughtful approach and storytelling.

Alex did a wonderful job weaving in historical and cultural context with each stop — not just talking about the dishes themselves, but also about how they fit into Romania’s broader culinary traditions and social history. He struck the perfect balance between sharing information and letting the group enjoy the moment. His passion for the city and its food came through clearly and made the whole experience feel authentic and memorable.

As for the food — it was abundant, varied, and absolutely delicious. Each stop offered something different, from traditional Romanian staples to lesser-known local specialties. We never felt rushed, and we definitely didn’t leave hungry! The pacing was just right, with plenty of time to enjoy each bite and chat with the others on the tour.

Overall, this tour was a highlight of our trip to Bucharest. Alex created a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere that brought strangers together over great food and conversation.

Our tour guide Nam was great from the get go my partners parents were a little hesitant about the 13km bike ride but Nam assured us it would be fine...it was for those of you worrying about the distance the bikes are easily pedalled and the terrain is mostly flat!
As for the the scenery pedalling through the rice paddies, shrimp farms and local villages with young kids running out to say hello is charming with Nam reiterating that the Vietnamese people are some of the most friendly people on the planet. His knowledge of the local area, farming techniques was a great insight into the resilience of the people.
The tour ends on a small fishing/river boat if you have experienced and dined on one of the larger boats with the buffets and entertainment this is the pleasant opposite.
Our captain & chef Mr. Rin greeted us with a big smile and welcomed us aboard as we sailed down the river and indulged in pork skewers, grilled shrimp, chicken and finished with a beef Banh Mi (yum) this tour concludes as you sail at sunset into the lantern covered hustle and bustle of Hoi An Ancient Town & is a great way to finish the tour.

Dear Ganendra Raj K, Can't Thank you enough for making the time and leaving another review for our Morning Walking Tour with our mighty Babis!!! For our team, it is very important to make our guests feel straight at home, especially the firsttimers, from the very moment they start their exploration of the city. We make sure you have tons of fun on our tour, but also we provide ideas of what you can experience while in Athens independently the following days, as an Athenian, not just the touristic highlight and a get a taste of our Philoxenia. So we are thrilled to read that you enjoyed the experience with Urban Adventures and we can only wish to see you again sometime soon :) From Babis and Urban Adventures Safe Travels and Sunny Regards

We met our friendly guide Brahim and the British couple that were also on the tour. Brahim explained the tour for us and we began walking around the Medina, starting in the Jewish quarter where we got to taste tea and freshly baked doughnuts, not like any we have tasted before. Thin crust and soft in the middle. Next stop was to taste different olives, spiced, green and black. Even those on the tour who didn't like olives found some of these very good. Now our guide stopped by a sweet booth where he bought some dessert for us to have after the main dinner. The main dinner was a delicious slow cooked meat in a restaurant that was already closed, since they close when everything is sold out. Our guide had reserved this for us. The last food we had was a homemade soup served at a stall in the middle of the square by the sons of the woman who cooked it earlier. Before we said goodbye, we had a spiced hot drink similar to Gluck wine or a Christmas drink. Brahim told us a lot about the culture and cuisine in Morocco. We highly recommend Brahim and this tour.

Hi Martin , I hope that you are well and thank you for your feedback. Did the guide have an Urban Adventures badge ? We don't have any guides named Mohamed , they are a lot of guides in front of café France that lie and tell people that they work for the company that the clients say so you can you can tag a long with them. We are sorry for the hassle caused by this , please reach out to us if you are in Marrakech again so we can redo the tour for you properly. Cheers, Marrakech UA

Hi Matthew - thanks so much for sharing your review, we really appreciate your recommendation and are sorry to hear the heat and busyness of the Grand Palace was a bit too much. In our peak tourist season it really does get packed with visitors. I'm also sorry to hear that it felt a bit rushed, it's really helpful for us to have this kind of feedback so we can work with our team to develop their skills and help them grow as guides. We aim to provide a 5 Star experience for all our customers so it's really helpful to know if we're not quite making it. Happy travels wherever they take you next :)

Hi Mackenzie, Thank you for your recent review. We are sorry to know that you did not have the experience as we always aim to deliver. We will be discussing your review with Mohammed in order to develop him in the ways that he is lacking- we apologize if you ever felt your guide to be condescending- this should never happen. The restaurant and outcome that your guide provided to you will also be reviewed. While we understand that Morocco is very much a tipping culture, the amounts should always be received with thanks. We appreciate the time you have taken to let us know about your experience, Mackenzie, and should you think to come along with us again we hope that you would consider a 15% Future Booking Voucher for the negative experience. We are happy to learn that you did have some positives from your tour time, and we hope that you enjoyed your time in Morocco. Stay well.

From start to finish, everything ran smoothly, and all provisions were perfectly taken care of — not a single detail was overlooked.

Our guide, Thanh, was exceptional — friendly, knowledgeable, and full of fascinating insights about the region. His storytelling made the history and culture of the Delta come alive. The drive to My Tho took around 2.5 hours, and from there, our private boat ride down the Mekong River was the perfect way to begin the adventure.

We visited a local fish farm and saw firsthand how the local industries thrive here. Sampling tropical fruits on a lush island was a refreshing treat, and the stop at the coconut candy factory was both educational and delicious! Thanh explained the entire candy-making process, and of course, we got to try some for ourselves.

One of the highlights was traveling by Xe Loi through local villages, which gave us a genuine glimpse into daily life. The bee farm visit was sweet (pun intended!), and the rowing boat ride through the narrow canals was peaceful and beautiful — a moment of true tranquility.

Lunch at Vuon Dau was a culinary delight. Thanh helped us navigate the menu and introduced us to some unforgettable local dishes. It was the perfect ending to a truly immersive experience.

I highly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to see the real Vietnam beyond the city. It was informative, relaxing, and incredibly fun.
